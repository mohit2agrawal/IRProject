At that time, Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha replied, "My dear Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi, I have already accepted the same post in a sacrifice begun by Lord Indra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 9.13.2</B></A>: "I shall return here after finishing the yaj&#241;a for Indra. Kindly wait for me until then." Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi remained silent, and Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha began to perform the sacrifice for Lord Indra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 9.13.3</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi, being a self-realized soul, considered that this life is flickering. Therefore, instead of waiting long for Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha, he began performing the sacrifice with other priests.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 9.13.4</B></A>: After completing the sacrificial performance for King Indra, the spiritual master Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha returned and found that his disciple Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi had disobeyed his instructions. Thus Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha cursed him, saying, "May the material body of Nimi, who considers himself learned, immediately fall."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm"><B>SB 9.13.5</B></A>: For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no offense, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi countercursed his spiritual master. "For the sake of getting contributions from the King of heaven," he said, "you have lost your religious intelligence. Therefore I pronounce this curse: your body also will fall."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm"><B>SB 9.13.6</B></A>: After saying this, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body. Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varun&#803;a when they saw Urva&#347;&#299;, he was born again.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 9.13.7</B></A>: During the performance of the yaj&#241;a, the body relinquished by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi was preserved in fragrant substances, and at the end of the Satra-y&#257;ga the great saints and br&#257;hman&#803;as made the following request to all the demigods assembled there.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 9.13.8</B></A>: "If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so, kindly bring Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi back to life in this body." The demigods said yes to this request by the sages, but Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi said, "Please do not imprison me again in a material body."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 9.13.9</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi continued: M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s generally want freedom from accepting a material body because they fear having to give it up again. But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 9.13.10</B></A>: I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all distress, lamentation and fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in anxiety because of fear of death.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 9.13.11</B></A>: The demigods said: Let Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi live without a material body. Let him live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, according to his desire, let him be manifest or unmanifest to common materially embodied people.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 9.13.12</B></A>: Thereafter, to save the people from the danger of an unregulated government, the sages churned Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Nimi's material body, from which, as a result, a son was born.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 9.13.13</B></A>: Because he was born in an unusual way, the son was called Janaka, and because he was born from the dead body of his father, he was known as Vaideha. Because he was born from the churning of his father's material body, he was known as Mithila, and because he constructed a city as King Mithila, the city was called Mithil&#257;.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 9.13.14</B></A>: O King Par&#299;ks&#803;it, from Mithila came a son named Ud&#257;vasu; from Ud&#257;vasu, Nandivardhana; from Nandivardhana, Suketu; and from Suketu, Devar&#257;ta.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 9.13.15</B></A>: From Devar&#257;ta came a son named Br&#803;hadratha and from Br&#803;hadratha a son named Mah&#257;v&#299;rya, who became the father of Sudhr&#803;ti.

Thus he was known as &#346;&#299;radhvaja.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 9.13.19</B></A>: The son of &#346;&#299;radhvaja was Ku&#347;adhvaja, and the son of Ku&#347;adhvaja was King Dharmadhvaja, who had two sons, namely Kr&#803;tadhvaja and Mitadhvaja.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20-21.htm"><B>SB 9.13.20-21</B></A>: O Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it, the son of Kr&#803;tadhvaja was Ke&#347;idhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was Kh&#257;n&#803;d&#803;ikya. The son of Kr&#803;tadhvaja was expert in spiritual knowledge, and the son of Mitadhvaja was expert in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Kh&#257;n&#803;d&#803;ikya fled in fear of Ke&#347;idhvaja. The son of Ke&#347;idhvaja was Bh&#257;num&#257;n, and the son of Bh&#257;num&#257;n was &#346;atadyumna.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 9.13.22</B></A>: The son of &#346;atadyumna was named &#346;uci.
