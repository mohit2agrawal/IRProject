Of these three, the sons and grandsons of Sabh&#257;nara were, in succession, K&#257;lanara, Sr&#803;&#241;jaya, Janamejaya, Mah&#257;&#347;&#257;la and Mah&#257;man&#257;. The sons of Mah&#257;man&#257; were U&#347;&#299;nara and Titiks&#803;u. U&#347;&#299;nara had four sons, namely &#346;ibi, Vara, Kr&#803;mi and Daks&#803;a. &#346;ibi also had four sons &#8212; Vr&#803;s&#803;&#257;darbha, Sudh&#299;ra, Madra and Kekaya. The son of Titiks&#803;u was Rus&#803;adratha, who begot a son named Homa. From Homa came Sutap&#257; and from Sutap&#257;, Bali. In this way the dynasty continued. Begotten by D&#299;rghatam&#257; in the womb of the wife of Bali were A&#324;ga, Va&#324;ga, Kali&#324;ga, Suhma, Pun&#803;d&#803;ra and Od&#803;ra, all of whom became kings.</P><P>From A&#324;ga came Khalap&#257;na, whose dynasty included Diviratha, Dharmaratha and Citraratha, also called Romap&#257;da, one after another. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Da&#347;aratha gave in charity one of his daughters, by the name &#346;&#257;nt&#257;, to his friend Romap&#257;da because Romap&#257;da had no sons. Romap&#257;da accepted &#346;&#257;nt&#257; as his daughter, and the great sage R&#803;s&#803;ya&#347;r&#803;&#324;ga married her. By the mercy of R&#803;s&#803;ya&#347;r&#803;&#324;ga, Romap&#257;da had a son named Catura&#324;ga. The son of Catura&#324;ga was Pr&#803;thul&#257;ks&#803;a, who had three sons &#8212; Br&#803;hadratha, Br&#803;hatkarm&#257; and Br&#803;hadbh&#257;nu. From Br&#803;hadratha came a son named Br&#803;hadman&#257;, whose sons and grandsons in succession were Jayadratha, Vijaya, Dhr&#803;ti, Dhr&#803;tavrata, Satkarm&#257; and Adhiratha. Adhiratha accepted the son rejected by Kunt&#299;, namely Karn&#803;a, and Karn&#803;a's son was Vr&#803;s&#803;asena.</P><P>The son of Yay&#257;ti's third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and grandsons were Setu, &#256;rabdha, G&#257;ndh&#257;ra, Dharma, Dhr&#803;ta, Durmada and Pracet&#257;.</P><P>The son of Yay&#257;ti's second son, Turvasu, was Vahni, whose seminal dynasty included Bharga, Bh&#257;num&#257;n, Tribh&#257;nu, Karandhama and Maruta. The childless Maruta accepted Dus&#803;manta, who belonged to the P&#363;ru dynasty, as his adopted son. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Dus&#803;manta was anxious to have his kingdom returned, and so he went back to the P&#363;ru-vam&#769;&#347;a.</P><P>Of the four sons of Yadu, Sahasrajit was the eldest. The son of Sahasrajit was named &#346;atajit. He had three sons, of whom one was Haihaya. The sons and grandsons in the dynasty of Haihaya were Dharma, Netra, Kunti, Soha&#241;ji, Mahis&#803;m&#257;n, Bhadrasenaka, Dhanaka, Kr&#803;tav&#299;rya, Arjuna, Jayadhvaja, T&#257;laja&#324;gha and V&#299;tihotra.</P><P>The son of V&#299;tihotra was Madhu, whose eldest son was Vr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;i. Because of Yadu, Madhu and Vr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;i, their dynasties are known as Y&#257;dava, M&#257;dhava and Vr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;i. Another son of Yadu was Kros&#803;t&#803;&#257;, and from him came Vr&#803;jinav&#257;n, Sv&#257;hita, Vis&#803;adgu, Citraratha, &#346;a&#347;abindu, Pr&#803;thu&#347;rav&#257;, Dharma, U&#347;an&#257; and Rucaka. Rucaka had five sons, one of whom was known as Jy&#257;magha. Jy&#257;magha was sonless, but by the mercy of the demigods his childless wife gave birth to a son named Vidarbha.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../22/49.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
