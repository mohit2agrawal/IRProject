It also describes Jar&#257;sandha, who belonged to the R&#803;ks&#803;a dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.</P><P>The son of Divod&#257;sa was Mitr&#257;yu, who had four sons, one after another &#8212; Cyavana, Sud&#257;sa, Sahadeva and Somaka. Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Pr&#803;s&#803;ata, from whom Drupada was born. Drupada's daughter was Draupad&#299;, and his sons were headed by Dhr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;adyumna. Dhr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;adyumna's son was Dhr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;aketu.</P><P>Another son of Ajam&#299;d&#803;ha was named R&#803;ks&#803;a. From R&#803;ks&#803;a came a son named Sam&#769;varan&#803;a, and from Sam&#769;varan&#803;a came Kuru, the king of Kuruks&#803;etra. Kuru had four sons &#8212; Par&#299;ks&#803;i, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nis&#803;adha. Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Kr&#803;t&#299; and Uparicara Vasu. The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Br&#803;hadratha, Ku&#347;&#257;mba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings of the Cedi state. In the dynasty from Br&#803;hadratha came Ku&#347;&#257;gra, R&#803;s&#803;abha, Satyahita, Pus&#803;pav&#257;n and Jahu, and from Br&#803;hadratha through the womb of another wife came Jar&#257;sandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Som&#257;pi and &#346;ruta&#347;rav&#257;. Par&#299;ks&#803;i, the son of Kuru, had no sons. Among the descendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Vid&#363;ratha, S&#257;rvabhauma, Jayasena, R&#257;dhika, Ayut&#257;yu, Akrodhana, Dev&#257;tithi, R&#803;ks&#803;a, Dil&#299;pa and Prat&#299;pa.</P><P>The sons of Prat&#299;pa were Dev&#257;pi, &#346;&#257;ntanu and B&#257;hl&#299;ka. When Dev&#257;pi retired to the forest, his younger brother &#346;&#257;ntanu became the king. Although &#346;&#257;ntanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years. Following the advice of the br&#257;hman&#803;as, &#346;&#257;ntanu was ready to return the kingdom to Dev&#257;pi, but by the intrigue of &#346;&#257;ntanu's minister, Dev&#257;pi became unfit to be king. Therefore &#346;&#257;ntanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime. By mystic power, Dev&#257;pi still lives in the village known as Kal&#257;pa-gr&#257;ma. In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vam&#769;&#347;a (the lunar dynasty) die out, Dev&#257;pi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The wife of &#346;&#257;ntanu named Ga&#324;g&#257; gave birth to Bh&#299;s&#803;ma, one of the twelve authorities. Two sons named Citr&#257;&#324;gada and Vicitrav&#299;rya were also born from the womb of Satyavat&#299; by the semen of &#346;&#257;ntanu, and Vy&#257;sadeva was born from Satyavat&#299; by the semen of Par&#257;&#347;ara, Vy&#257;sadeva instructed the history of the Bh&#257;gavatam to his son &#346;ukadeva. Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitrav&#299;rya, Vy&#257;sadeva begot Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra, P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;u and Vidura.</P><P>Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duh&#803;&#347;al&#257;. P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;u had five sons, headed by Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupad&#299;. The names of these sons of Draupad&#299; were Prativindhya, &#346;rutasena, &#346;rutak&#299;rti, &#346;at&#257;n&#299;ka and &#346;rutakarm&#257;. Besides these five sons, by other wives the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghat&#803;otkaca, Sarvagata, Suhotra, Naramitra, Ir&#257;v&#257;n, Babhruv&#257;hana and Abhimanyu. From Abhimanyu, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it was born, and Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it had four sons &#8212; Janamejaya, &#346;rutasena, Bh&#299;masena and Ugrasena.</P><P>Next &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; described the future sons of the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;u family. From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named &#346;at&#257;n&#299;ka, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasr&#257;n&#299;ka, A&#347;vamedhaja, As&#299;makr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Nemicakra, Citraratha, &#346;uciratha, Vr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;im&#257;n, Sus&#803;en&#803;a, Sun&#299;tha, Nr&#803;caks&#803;u, Sukh&#299;nala, Pariplava, Sunaya, Medh&#257;v&#299;, Nr&#803;pa&#241;jaya, D&#363;rva, Timi, Br&#803;hadratha, Sud&#257;sa, &#346;at&#257;n&#299;ka, Durdamana, Mah&#299;nara, Dan&#803;d&#803;ap&#257;n&#803;i, Nimi and Ks&#803;emaka.</P><P>&#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; then predicted the kings of the m&#257;gadha-vam&#769;&#347;a, or M&#257;gadha dynasty. Sahadeva, the son of Jar&#257;sandha, would beget M&#257;rj&#257;ri, and from him would come &#346;ruta&#347;rav&#257;. Subsequently taking birth in the dynasty will be Yut&#257;yu, Niramitra, Sunaks&#803;atra, Br&#803;hatsena, Karmajit, Suta&#241;jaya, Vipra, &#346;uci, Ks&#803;ema, Suvrata, Dharmas&#363;tra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sun&#299;tha, Satyajit, Vi&#347;vajit and Ripu&#241;jaya.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../21/36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
