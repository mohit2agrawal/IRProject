Of these three, Romap&#257;da expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Kr&#803;ti, U&#347;ika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings.

From the womb of Rohin&#803;&#299;, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, S&#257;ran&#803;a, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Kr&#803;ta and others. Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devak&#299; was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons.
