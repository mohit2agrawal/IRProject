One of these sons, Pr&#803;s&#803;adhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Pr&#803;s&#803;adhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger. Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a &#347;&#363;dra family, but Pr&#803;s&#803;adhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.</P><P>Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu's son known as Kar&#363;s&#803;a, a sect of ks&#803;atriyas known as K&#257;r&#363;s&#803;as was generated. Manu also had a son known as Dhr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;a, from whom another sect of ks&#803;atriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a ks&#803;atriya, they became br&#257;hman&#803;as. From Nr&#803;ga, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bh&#363;tajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in succession, came Prat&#299;ka, and from him came Oghav&#257;n. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Naris&#803;yanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, R&#803;ks&#803;a, M&#299;d&#803;hv&#257;n, P&#363;rn&#803;a, Indrasena, V&#299;tihotra, Satya&#347;rav&#257;, Uru&#347;rav&#257;, Devadatta and Agnive&#347;ya. From the ks&#803;atriya known as Agnive&#347;ya came the celebrated br&#257;hman&#803;a dynasty known as &#256;gnive&#347;y&#257;yana. From the seminal dynasty of Dis&#803;t&#803;a, another son of Manu, came N&#257;bh&#257;ga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapr&#299;ti, Pr&#257;m&#769;&#347;u, Pramati, Khanitra, C&#257;ks&#803;us&#803;a, Vivim&#769;&#347;ati, Rambha, Khan&#299;netra, Karandhama, Av&#299;ks&#803;it, Marutta, Dama, R&#257;jyavardhana, Sudhr&#803;ti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhum&#257;n, Vegav&#257;n, Budha and Tr&#803;n&#803;abindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty. From Tr&#803;n&#803;abindu came a daughter named Ilavil&#257;, from whom Kuvera took birth. Tr&#803;n&#803;abindu also had three sons, named Vi&#347;&#257;la, &#346;&#363;nyabandhu and Dh&#363;mraketu. The son of Vi&#347;&#257;la was Hemacandra, his son was Dh&#363;mr&#257;ks&#803;a, and his son was Sam&#769;yama. The sons of Sam&#769;yama were Devaja and Kr&#803;&#347;&#257;&#347;va. Kr&#803;&#347;&#257;&#347;va's son, Somadatta, performed an A&#347;vamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vis&#803;n&#803;u, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../1/42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
