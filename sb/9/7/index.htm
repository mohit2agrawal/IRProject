Ambar&#299;s&#803;a was accepted as son by his grandfather Yuvan&#257;&#347;va. Ambar&#299;s&#803;a's son was Yauvan&#257;&#347;va, and Yauvan&#257;&#347;va's son was H&#257;r&#299;ta. In M&#257;ndh&#257;t&#257;'s dynasty, Ambar&#299;s&#803;a, H&#257;r&#299;ta and Yauvan&#257;&#347;va were very prominent.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm"><B>SB 9.7.2</B></A>: The serpent brothers of Narmad&#257; gave Narmad&#257; to Purukutsa. Being sent by V&#257;suki, she took Purukutsa to the lower region of the universe.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm"><B>SB 9.7.3</B></A>: There in Ras&#257;tala, the lower region of the universe, Purukutsa, being empowered by Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, was able to kill all the Gandharvas who deserved to be killed. Purukutsa received the benediction from the serpents that anyone who remembers this history of his being brought by Narmad&#257; to the lower region of the universe will be assured of safety from the attack of snakes.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm"><B>SB 9.7.4</B></A>: The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, who was the father of Anaran&#803;ya. Anaran&#803;ya's son was Harya&#347;va, the father of Pr&#257;run&#803;a. Pr&#257;run&#803;a was the father of Tribandhana.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="5-6.htm"><B>SB 9.7.5-6</B></A>: The son of Tribandhana was Satyavrata, who is celebrated by the name Tri&#347;a&#324;ku. Because he kidnapped the daughter of a br&#257;hman&#803;a when she was being married, his father cursed him to become a can&#803;d&#803;&#257;la, lower than a &#347;&#363;dra. Thereafter, by the influence of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, he went to the higher planetary system, the heavenly planets, in his material body, but because of the prowess of the demigods he fell back downward. Nonetheless, by the power of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, he did not fall all the way down; even today he can still be seen hanging in the sky, head downward.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm"><B>SB 9.7.7</B></A>: The son of Tri&#347;a&#324;ku was Hari&#347;candra. Because of Hari&#347;candra there was a quarrel between Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra and Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha, who for many years fought one another, having been transformed into birds.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="8.htm"><B>SB 9.7.8</B></A>: Hari&#347;candra had no son and was therefore extremely morose. Once, therefore, following the advice of N&#257;rada, he took shelter of Varun&#803;a and said to him "My lord I have no son. Would you kindly give me one?"</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="9.htm"><B>SB 9.7.9</B></A>: O King Par&#299;ks&#803;it, Hari&#347;candra begged Varun&#803;a, "My lord, if a son is born to me, with that son I shall perform a sacrifice for your satisfaction." When Hari&#347;candra said this, Varun&#803;a replied, "Let it be so." Because of Varun&#803;a's benediction, Hari&#347;candra begot a son named Rohita.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm"><B>SB 9.7.10</B></A>: Thereafter, when the child was born, Varun&#803;a approached Hari&#347;candra and said, "Now you have a son. With this son you can offer me a sacrifice." In answer to this, Hari&#347;candra said, "After ten days have passed since an animal's birth, the animal becomes fit to be sacrificed."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="11.htm"><B>SB 9.7.11</B></A>: After ten days, Varun&#803;a came again and said to Hari&#347;candra, "Now you can perform the sacrifice." Hari&#347;candra replied, "When an animal grows teeth, then it becomes pure enough to be sacrificed."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm"><B>SB 9.7.12</B></A>: When the teeth grew, Varun&#803;a came and said to Hari&#347;candra, "Now the animal has grown teeth, and you can perform the sacrifice." Hari&#347;candra replied, "When all its teeth have fallen out, then it will be fit for sacrifice."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm"><B>SB 9.7.13</B></A>: When the teeth had fallen out, Varun&#803;a returned and said to Hari&#347;candra, "Now the animal's teeth have fallen out, and you can perform the sacrifice." But Hari&#347;candra replied, "When the animal's teeth grow in again, then he will be pure enough to be sacrificed."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm"><B>SB 9.7.14</B></A>: When the teeth grew in again, Varun&#803;a came and said to Hari&#347;candra, "Now you can perform the sacrifice." But Hari&#347;candra then said, "O King, when the sacrificial animal becomes a ks&#803;atriya and is able to shield himself to fight with the enemy, then he will be purified."</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm"><B>SB 9.7.15</B></A>: Hari&#347;candra was certainly very much attached to his son. Because of this affection, he asked the demigod Varun&#803;a to wait. Thus Varun&#803;a waited and waited for the time to come.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm"><B>SB 9.7.16</B></A>: Rohita could understand that his father intended to offer him as the animal for sacrifice. Therefore, just to save himself from death, he equipped himself with bow and arrows and went to the forest.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm"><B>SB 9.7.17</B></A>: When Rohita heard that his father had been attacked by dropsy due to Varun&#803;a and that his abdomen had grown very large, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra forbade him to do so.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm"><B>SB 9.7.18</B></A>: King Indra advised Rohita to travel to different pilgrimage sites and holy places, for such activities are pious indeed. Following this instruction, Rohita went to the forest for one year.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm"><B>SB 9.7.19</B></A>: In this way, at the end of the second, third, fourth and fifth years, when Rohita wanted to return to his capital, the King of heaven, Indra, approached him as an old br&#257;hman&#803;a and forbade him to return, repeating the same words as in the previous year.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm"><B>SB 9.7.20</B></A>: Thereafter, in the sixth year, after wandering in the forest, Rohita returned to the capital of his father. He purchased from Aj&#299;garta his second son, named &#346;unah&#803;&#347;epha. Then he offered &#346;unah&#803;&#347;epha to his father, Hari&#347;candra, to be used as the sacrificial animal and offered Hari&#347;candra his respectful obeisances.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="21.htm"><B>SB 9.7.21</B></A>: Thereafter, the famous King Hari&#347;candra, one of the exalted persons in history, performed grand sacrifices by sacrificing a man and pleased all the demigods. In this way his dropsy created by Varun&#803;a was cured.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm"><B>SB 9.7.22</B></A>: In that great human sacrifice, Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra was the chief priest to offer oblations, the perfectly self-realized Jamadagni had the responsibility for chanting the mantras from the Yajur Veda, Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha was the chief brahminical priest, and the sage Ay&#257;sya was the reciter of the hymns of the S&#257;ma Veda.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm"><B>SB 9.7.23</B></A>: King Indra, being very pleased with Hari&#347;candra, offered him a gift of a golden chariot. &#346;unah&#803;&#347;epha's glories will be presented along with the description of the son of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm"><B>SB 9.7.24</B></A>: The great sage Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra saw that Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Hari&#347;candra, along with his wife, was truthful, forbearing and concerned with the essence. Thus he gave them imperishable knowledge for fulfillment of the human mission.</P><P CLASS=r><A CLASS=i HREF="25-26.htm"><B>SB 9.7.25-26</B></A>: Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Hari&#347;candra first purified his mind, which was full of material enjoyment, by amalgamating it with the earth. Then he amalgamated the earth with water, the water with fire, the fire with the air, and the air with the sky. Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total material energy with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization of one's self as part of the Supreme Lord. When the self-realized spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally imperceptible and inconceivable. Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from material bondage.</P><P CLASS=f><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
