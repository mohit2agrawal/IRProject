He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He taught good behavior for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. Thus He taught the general public by His personal activities.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Eka-patn&#299;-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by Lord R&#257;macandra. One should not accept more than one wife. In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord R&#257;macandra's father accepted more wives than one. But Lord R&#257;macandra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother S&#299;t&#257;. When mother S&#299;t&#257; was kidnapped by R&#257;van&#803;a and the R&#257;ks&#803;asas, Lord R&#257;macandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of S&#299;t&#257;s, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with R&#257;van&#803;a and finally killed him. The Lord punished R&#257;van&#803;a and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife. Lord R&#257;macandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder should live according to the ideal of Lord R&#257;macandra, who showed how to be a perfect person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma. Those who live in accordance with these principles, whether as householders, brahmac&#257;r&#299;s or v&#257;naprasthas, are all equally important.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
