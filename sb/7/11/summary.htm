Now he inquired from N&#257;rada Muni about the actual religion of a human being and about special characteristics of varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, which marks the highest status of human civilization. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira asked N&#257;rada Muni about these matters, N&#257;rada Muni stopped giving his own statements and quoted statements by Lord N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a, for He is the supreme authority for giving religious codes (dharmam&#769; tu s&#257;ks&#803;&#257;d bhagavat-pran&#803;&#299;tam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../6/3/19.htm">SB 6.3.19</A>]). Every human being is expected to acquire thirty qualities, such as truthfulness, mercy and austerity. The process of following the priniples of religion is known as san&#257;tana-dharma, the eternal religious system.</P><P>The varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama system delineates the divisions of br&#257;hman&#803;a, ks&#803;atriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra. It also sets forth the system of sam&#769;sk&#257;ras. The garbh&#257;dh&#257;na sam&#769;sk&#257;ra, the ceremony for begetting a child, must be observed by the higher section of people, namely the dvijas. One who follows the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na sam&#769;sk&#257;ra system is actually twice-born, but those who do not, who deviate from the principles of varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma, are called dvija-bandhus. The principal occupations for a br&#257;hman&#803;a are worshiping the Deity, teaching others how to worship the Deity, studying the Vedic literatures, teaching the Vedic literatures, accepting charity from others and again giving charity to others. A br&#257;hman&#803;a should make his livelihood from these six occupational duties. The duty of a ks&#803;atriya is to give protection to the citizens and levy taxes upon them, but he is forbidden to tax the br&#257;hman&#803;as. The members of the Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness movement should therefore be exempt from government taxation. Ks&#803;atriyas may tax everyone but the br&#257;hman&#803;as. Vai&#347;yas should cultivate the land, produce food grains and protect the cows, whereas the &#347;&#363;dras, who by quality never become br&#257;hman&#803;as, ks&#803;atriyas or vai&#347;yas, should serve the three higher classes and be satisfied. Other means of livelihood are also prescribed for the br&#257;hman&#803;as, and these are four &#8212; &#347;&#257;l&#299;na, y&#257;y&#257;vara, &#347;ila, and u&#241;chana. Each of these occupational duties is successively better.</P><P>One who is in a lower grade of social life cannot accept the profession of a higher class unless necessary. In times of emergency, all the classes but the ks&#803;atriyas may accept professional duties of others. The means of livelihood known as r&#803;ta (&#347;ilo&#241;chana), amr&#803;ta (ay&#257;cita), mr&#803;ta (y&#257;c&#241;&#257;), pramr&#803;ta (kars&#803;an&#803;a), and saty&#257;nr&#803;ta (v&#257;n&#803;ijya) may be accepted by everyone but the ks&#803;atriyas. For a br&#257;hman&#803;a or a ks&#803;atriya, engaging in the service of the vai&#347;yas or &#347;&#363;dras is considered the profession of dogs.</P><P>N&#257;rada Muni also described that the symptom of a br&#257;hman&#803;a is controlled senses, the symptoms of a ks&#803;atriya are power and fame, the symptom of a vai&#347;ya is service to the br&#257;hman&#803;as and ks&#803;atriyas, and the symptom of a &#347;&#363;dra is service to the three higher classes. The qualification for a woman is to be a very faithful and chaste wife. In this way, N&#257;rada Muni described the characteristics of higher and lower grades of people and recommended that one follow the principles of his caste or his hereditary occupation. One cannot suddenly give up a profession to which he is accustomed, and therefore it is recommended that one gradually be awakened. The symptoms of br&#257;hman&#803;as, ks&#803;atriyas, vai&#347;yas, and &#347;&#363;dras are very important, and therefore one should be designated only by these symptoms, and not by birth. Designation by birth is strictly forbidden by N&#257;rada Muni and all great personalities.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../10/70.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
