His wonderful creative power, yogam&#257;y&#257;, cannot be easily understood even by the masters of yoga. That most ancient person, the Personality of Godhead, will alone come to our rescue. What purpose can we serve on His behalf by deliberating on the subject?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>When something is arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not be disturbed by it, even if it appears to be a reverse according to one's calculations. For example, sometimes we see that a powerful preacher is killed, or sometimes he is put into difficulty, just as Harid&#257;sa T&#803;h&#257;kura was. He was a great devotee who came into this material world to execute the will of the Lord by preaching the Lord's glories. But Harid&#257;sa was punished at the hands of the Kazi by being beaten in twenty-two marketplaces. Similarly, Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, and Prahl&#257;da Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was put through so many tribulations. The P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas, who were direct friends of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, lost their kingdom, their wife was insulted, and they had to undergo many severe tribulations. Seeing all these reverses affect devotees, one should not be disturbed; one should simply understand that in these matters there must be some plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Bh&#257;gavatam's conclusion is that a devotee is never disturbed by such reverses. He accepts even reverse conditions as the grace of the Lord. One who continues to serve the Lord even in reverse conditions is assured that he will go back to Godhead, back to the Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha planets. Lord Brahm&#257; assured the demigods that there was no use in talking about how the disturbing situation of darkness was taking place, since the actual fact was that it was ordered by the Supreme Lord. Brahm&#257; knew this because he was a great devotee; it was possible for him to understand the plan of the Lord.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, entitled "The Two Doorkeepers of Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha, Jaya and Vijaya, Cursed by the Sages."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../17/1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
