These descriptions are certainly not the imagination of Kardama Muni. The decorations of the Lord are beyond material conception, as admitted even by impersonalists like &#346;a&#324;kar&#257;c&#257;rya: N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has nothing to do with the material creation. The varieties of the transcendental Lord &#8212; His body, His form, His dress, His instruction, His words &#8212; are not manufactured by the material energy, but are all confirmed in the Vedic literature. By performance of yoga Kardama Muni actually saw the Supreme Lord as He is. There was no point in seeing an imagined form of God after practicing yoga for ten thousand years. The perfection of yoga, therefore, does not terminate in voidness or impersonalism; on the contrary, the perfection of yoga is attained when one actually sees the Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. The process of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness is to deliver the form of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a directly. The form of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is described in the authoritative Vedic literature Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257;: His abode is made of cint&#257;man&#803;i stone, and the Lord plays there as a cowherd boy and is served by many thousands of gop&#299;s. These descriptions are authoritative, and a Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a conscious person takes them directly, acts on them, preaches them and practices devotional service as enjoined in the authoritative scriptures.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
