The Lord foretold to Kardama Muni that He would appear in His incarnation Kapiladeva and would propagate the philosophy of S&#257;&#324;khya. S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy is very well known in the world as propagated by another Kapiladeva, but that S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy is different from the S&#257;&#324;khya which was propounded by the Lord Himself. There are two kinds of S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy: one is godless S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy, and the other is godly S&#257;&#324;khya philosophy. The S&#257;&#324;khya propagated by Kapiladeva, son of Devah&#363;ti, is godly philosophy.</P><P>There are different manifestations of the Lord. He is one, but He has become many. He divides Himself into two different expansions, one called kal&#257; and the other vibhinn&#257;m&#769;&#347;a. Ordinary living entities are called vibhinn&#257;m&#769;&#347;a expansions, and the unlimited expansions of vis&#803;n&#803;u-tattva, such as V&#257;mana, Govinda, N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a, Pradyumna, V&#257;sudeva and Ananta, are called sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a-kal&#257;. Sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a refers to a direct expansion, and kal&#257; denotes an expansion from the expansion of the original Lord. Baladeva is an expansion of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and from Baladeva the next expansion is Sa&#324;kars&#803;an&#803;a; thus Sa&#324;kars&#803;an&#803;a is kal&#257;, but Baladeva is sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a. There is no difference, however, among Them. This is very nicely explained in the Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/46.htm">5.46</A>): d&#299;p&#257;rcir eva hi da&#347;&#257;ntaram abhyupetya. With one candle one may light a second candle, with the second a third and then a fourth, and in this way one can light up thousands of candles, and no candle is inferior to another in distributing light. Every candle has the full potential candlepower, but there is still the distinction that one candle is the first, another the second, another the third and another the fourth. Similarly, there is no difference between the immediate expansion of the Lord and His secondary expansion. The Lord's names are considered in exactly the same way; since the Lord is absolute, His name, His form, His pastimes, His paraphernalia and His quality all have the same potency. In the absolute world, the name Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. There is no potential difference between His quality, name, form, etc. If we chant the name of the Lord, Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, that has as much potency as the Lord Himself. There is no potential difference between the form of the Lord whom we worship and the form of the Lord in the temple. One should not think that one is worshiping a doll or statue of the Lord, even if others consider it to be a statue. Because there is not potential difference, one gets the same result by worshiping the statue of the Lord or the Lord Himself. This is the science of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="31.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
