One can reestablish the transcendental loving relationship with the Supreme Lord in so many ways, and that feeling is true oneness. The oneness of the M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers and the oneness of Vais&#803;n&#803;ava philosophers are different. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; and Vais&#803;n&#803;ava philosophers both want to merge into the Supreme, but the Vais&#803;n&#803;avas do not lose their identities. They want to keep the identity of lover, parent, friend or servant.</P><P>In the transcendental world, the servant and master are one. That is the absolute platform. Although the relationship is servant and master, both the servant and the served stand on the same platform. That is oneness. Lord Kapila advised His mother that she did not need any indirect process. She was already situated in that direct process because the Supreme Lord had taken birth as her son. Actually, she did not need any further instruction because she was already in the perfectional stage. Kapiladeva advised her to continue in the same way. He therefore addressed His mother as bh&#257;mini to indicate that she was already thinking of the Lord as her son. Devah&#363;ti is advised by Lord Kapila to take directly to devotional service, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, because without that consciousness one cannot become liberated from the clutches of m&#257;y&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12-15.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
