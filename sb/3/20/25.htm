For example, Hanum&#257;nj&#299; (Vajr&#257;&#324;gaj&#299;) wanted to see the form of the Lord as the Personality of Godhead R&#257;macandra, whereas other Vais&#803;n&#803;avas want to see the form of R&#257;dh&#257;-Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and still other devotees want to see the Lord in the form of Laks&#803;m&#299;-N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a. The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers think that although all these forms are assumed by the Lord just as the devotees desire to see Him, actually He is impersonal. From Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257;, however, we can understand that this is not so, for the Lord has multiforms. It is said in the Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257;, advaitam acyutam. The Lord does not appear before the devotee because of the devotee's imagination. Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257; further explains that the Lord has innumerable forms: r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rtis&#803;u kal&#257;-niyamena tis&#803;t&#803;han [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/39.htm">Bs. 5.39</A>]. He exists in millions and millions of forms. There are 8,400,000 spieces of living entities, but the incarnations of the Supreme Lord are innumerable. In the Bh&#257;gavatam it is stated that as the waves in the sea cannot be counted but appear and disappear continually, the incarnations and forms of the Lord are innumerable. A devotee is attached to a particular form, and it is that form which he worships. We have just described the first appearance of the boar within this universe. There are innumerable universes, and somewhere or other the boar form is now existing. All the forms of the Lord are eternal. It is the devotee's inclination to worship a particular form, and he engages in devotional service to that form. In a verse in the R&#257;m&#257;yan&#803;a, Hanum&#257;n, the great devotee of R&#257;ma, said, "I know that there is no difference between the S&#299;t&#257;-R&#257;ma and Laks&#803;m&#299;-N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but nevertheless, the form of R&#257;ma and S&#299;t&#257; has absorbed my affection and love. Therefore I want to see the Lord in the forms of R&#257;ma and S&#299;t&#257;." Similarly, the Gaud&#803;&#299;ya Vais&#803;n&#803;ava loves the forms of R&#257;dh&#257; and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and Rukmin&#803;&#299; at Dv&#257;rak&#257;. The words bhakt&#257;n&#257;m anur&#363;p&#257;tma-dar&#347;anam mean that the Lord is always pleased to favor the devotee in the particular form in which the devotee wants to worship and render service unto Him. In this verse it is stated that Brahm&#257; approached Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This form of the Lord is Ks&#803;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vis&#803;n&#803;u. Whenever there is some trouble and Brahm&#257; has to approach the Lord, he can approach Ks&#803;&#299;rodaka&#347;&#257;y&#299; Vis&#803;n&#803;u, and it is the grace of the Lord that whenever Brahm&#257; approaches about disturbances in the universe, the Lord gives him relief in so many ways.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
