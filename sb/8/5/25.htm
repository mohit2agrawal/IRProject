Simply because Lord Brahm&#257; had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>It is said that when Brahm&#257; and the other demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, they cannot directly see Him, but their prayers are heard by the Lord, and the needful action is taken. This we have seen in many instances. The word &#347;ruta-p&#363;rv&#257;ya is significant. We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing. If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources. Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God. This is ludicrous. It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God. Our sensory perception is always incomplete. Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him. When Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Avaj&#257;nanti m&#257;m&#769; m&#363;d&#803;h&#257; m&#257;nus&#803;&#299;m&#769; tanum &#257;&#347;ritam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/9/11.htm">Bg. 9.11</A>]. Even though the rascals and fools saw Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him. Therefore we have to hear about God, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly. Even though Brahm&#257; had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in &#346;vetadv&#299;pa. Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord.</P><P>These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers. Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words daiv&#299;bhir g&#299;rbhih&#803;. In our Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees. We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple. We generally sing two songs. One is &#347;r&#299;-kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a-caitanya prabhu nity&#257;nanda &#347;r&#299;-advaita gad&#257;dhara &#347;r&#299;v&#257;s&#257;di-gaura-bhakta-vr&#803;nda. This is bona fide. It is always mentioned in the Caitanya-carit&#257;mr&#803;ta, and it is accepted by the &#257;c&#257;ryas. The other, of course, is the mah&#257;-mantra &#8212; Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. We may also sing the songs of Narottama d&#257;sa T&#803;h&#257;kura, Bhaktivinoda T&#803;h&#257;kura and Locana d&#257;sa T&#803;h&#257;kura, but these two songs &#8212; "&#347;r&#299;-kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a-caitanya" and the Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a mah&#257;-mantra &#8212; are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him. Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="26.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
