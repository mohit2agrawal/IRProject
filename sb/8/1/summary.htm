Sometime in the year 1935 when His Divine Grace was staying at R&#257;dh&#257;-kun&#803;d&#803;a, I went to see him from Bombay. At that time, he gave me many important instructions in regard to constructing temples and publishing books. He personally told me that publishing books is more important than constructing temples. Of course, those same instructions remained within my mind for many years. In 1944 I began publishing my Back to Godhead, and when I retired from family life in 1958 I began publishing &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam in Delhi. When three parts of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam had been published in India, I then started for the United States of America on the thirteenth of August, 1965.</P><P>I am continuously trying to publish books, as suggested by my spiritual master. Now, in this year, 1976, I have completed the Seventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, and a summary of the Tenth Canto has already been published as Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, the Eighth Canto, Ninth Canto, Tenth Canto, Eleventh Canto and Twelfth Canto are yet to be published. On this occasion, therefore, I am praying to my spiritual master to give me strength to finish this work. I am neither a great scholar nor a great devotee; I am simply a humble servant of my spiritual master, and to the best of my ability I am trying to please him by publishing these books, with the cooperation of my disciples in America. Fortunately, scholars all over the world are appreciating these publications. Let us cooperatively publish more and more volumes of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam just to please His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; T&#803;h&#257;kura.</P><P>This First Chapter of the Eighth Canto may be summarized as a description of four Manus, namely Sv&#257;yambhuva, Sv&#257;rocis&#803;a, Uttama and T&#257;masa. After hearing descriptions of the dynasty of Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu until the end of the Seventh Canto, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it desired to know about other Manus. He desired to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends &#8212; not only in the past but at the present and in the future &#8212; and how He acts in various pastimes as Manu. Since Par&#299;ks&#803;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was eager to know all this, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; gradually described all the Manus, beginning with the six Manus who had appeared in the past.</P><P>The first Manu was Sv&#257;yambhuva Manu. His two daughters, namely &#256;k&#363;ti and Devah&#363;ti, gave birth to two sons, named Yaj&#241;a and Kapila respectively. Because &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; had already described the activities of Kapila in the Third Canto, he now described the activities of Yaj&#241;a. The original Manu, along with his wife, &#346;atar&#363;p&#257;, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunand&#257;. They practiced austerities for a hundred years, and then Manu, in a trance, formed prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. R&#257;ks&#803;asas and asuras then attempted to devour him, but Yaj&#241;a, accompanied by his sons the Y&#257;mas and the demigods, killed them. Then Yaj&#241;a personally took the post of Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</P><P>The second Manu, whose name was Sv&#257;rocis&#803;a, was the son of Agni, and His sons were headed by Dyumat, Sus&#803;en&#803;a and Rocis&#803;mat. In the age of this Manu, Rocana became Indra, the ruler of the heavenly planets, and there were many demigods, headed by Tus&#803;ita. There were also many saintly persons, such as &#362;rja and Stambha. Among them was Veda&#347;ir&#257;, whose wife, Tus&#803;it&#257;, gave birth to Vibhu. Vibhu instructed eighty-eight thousand dr&#803;d&#803;ha-vratas, or saintly persons, on self-control and austerity.</P><P>Uttama, the son of Priyavrata, was the third Manu. Among his sons were Pavana, Sr&#803;&#241;jaya and Yaj&#241;ahotra. During the reign of this Manu, the sons of Vasis&#803;t&#803;ha, headed by Pramada, became the seven saintly persons. The Satyas, Deva&#347;rutas and Bhadras became the demigods, and Satyajit became Indra. From the womb of Sunr&#803;t&#257;, the wife of Dharma, the Lord appeared as Satyasena, and He killed all the Yaks&#803;as and R&#257;ks&#803;asas who were fighting with Satyajit.</P><P>T&#257;masa, the brother of the third Manu, was the fourth Manu, and he had ten sons, including Pr&#803;thu, Khy&#257;ti, Nara and Ketu. During his reign, the Satyakas, Haris, V&#299;ras and others were demigods, the seven great saints were headed by Jyotirdh&#257;ma, and Tri&#347;ikha became Indra. Harimedh&#257; begot a son named Hari in the womb of his wife Harin&#803;&#299;. This Hari, an incarnation of God, saved the devotee Gajendra. This incident is described as gajendra-moks&#803;an&#803;a. At the end of this chapter, Par&#299;ks&#803;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja particularly asks about this incident.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../../7/15/80.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
