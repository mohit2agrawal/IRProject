Devak&#299;, having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the original consciousness for everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the rising moon.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As indicated here by the word manastah&#803;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was transferred from the core of Vasudeva's mind or heart to the core of the heart of Devak&#299;. We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred to Devak&#299; not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by d&#299;ks&#803;&#257;, initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one's own heart.</P><P>The word acyut&#257;m&#769;&#347;am is used because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is S&#803;ad&#803;-ai&#347;varya-p&#363;rn&#803;a, full in the opulences of wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. The Supreme Godhead is never separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/39.htm">5.39</A>), r&#257;m&#257;di-m&#363;rtis&#803;u kal&#257;-niyamena tis&#803;t&#803;han: the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as R&#257;ma, Nr&#803;sim&#769;ha and Var&#257;ha. Therefore the word acyut&#257;m&#769;&#347;am is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as yog&#299;s do. Dhy&#257;n&#257;vasthita-tad-gatena manas&#257; pa&#347;yanti yam&#769; yoginah&#803; (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/12/13/1.htm">12.13.1</A>). Yog&#299;s meditate upon the Supreme person within the mind. For a devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devak&#299;, for His presence within the core of her heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was begotten by Vasudeva within the womb of Devak&#299; and that she carried the child within her womb.</P><P>When Vasudeva was sustaining the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, he appeared just like the glowing sun, whose shining rays are always unbearable and scorching to the common man. The form of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. The appearance of the form of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called dh&#257;ma. Dh&#257;ma refers not only to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest simultaneously.</P><P>Thus the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full potencies was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devak&#299;, exactly as the setting sun's rays are transferred to the full moon rising in the east.</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered the body of Devak&#299; from the body of Vasudeva. He was beyond the conditions of the ordinary living entity. When Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary expansions, such as N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a, and incarnations like Lord Nr&#803;sim&#769;ha and Var&#257;ha, are with Him, and they are not subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devak&#299; became the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devak&#299; became the residence of the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Kam&#769;sa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is not very much appreciated. So Devak&#299; was kept within the prison walls of Kam&#769;sa's palace, and no one could see her transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</P><P>Commenting upon this verse, &#346;r&#299; V&#299;rar&#257;ghava &#256;c&#257;rya writes, vasudeva-devak&#299; jat&#803;harayor hr&#803;dayayor bhagavatah&#803; sambandhah&#803;. The Supreme Lord's entrance into the womb of Devak&#299; from the heart of Vasudeva was a heart-to-heart relationship.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="19.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
