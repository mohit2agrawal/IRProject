(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/44/8.htm">10.44.8</A>) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows:</P><P>kaum&#257;ram&#769; pa&#241;cam&#257;bd&#257;ntam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>paugan&#803;d&#803;am&#769; da&#347;am&#257;vadhi</P><P CLASS=n>kai&#347;oram &#257;-pa&#241;cada&#347;&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>yauvanam&#769; tu tatah&#803; param</P><P>'The kaum&#257;ra stage lasts until the age of five, paugan&#803;d&#803;a up to age ten and kai&#347;ora to age fifteen. From then on, one is known as yauvana.' According to this statement, the kai&#347;ora period ends at the age of fifteen. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was only eleven years old when He killed Kam&#769;sa, according to Uddhava's words: ek&#257;da&#347;a-sam&#257;s tatra g&#363;d&#803;h&#257;rcih&#803; sa-balo 'vasat. 'Like a covered flame, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a remained there incognito with Balar&#257;ma for eleven years' (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/3/2/26.htm">3.2.26</A>) And since Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and Balar&#257;ma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bh&#363;mi, it was at the time [of Their going to Mathur&#257;] that Their kai&#347;ora stage began rather than ended.</P><P>"This objection to Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's statement in the present verse &#8212; that His parents could not enjoy His kai&#347;ora stage &#8212; is based on ordinary measurement of age. Yet we should consider the following statement [from the Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../10/8/26.htm">10.8.26</A>)]:</P><P>k&#257;len&#257;lpena r&#257;jars&#803;e</P><P CLASS=n>r&#257;mah&#803; kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a&#347; ca go-vraje</P><P CLASS=n>aghr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;a-j&#257;nubhih&#803; padbhir</P><P CLASS=n>vicakramatur a&#241;jas&#257;</P><P>'O King Par&#299;ks&#803;it, within a short time R&#257;ma and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a began to walk very easily in Gokula on Their legs, by Their own strength, without the need to crawl.' Sometimes we see that the son of a king, even while in his paugan&#803;d&#803;a stage of life, undergoes exceptional physical growth and exhibits activities appropriate to a kai&#347;ora. Then what to speak of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, whose exceptional growth is established in the Vais&#803;n&#803;ava-tos&#803;an&#803;&#299;, Bhakti-ras&#257;mr&#803;ta-sindhu, &#256;nanda-vr&#803;ndavana-camp&#363; and other works?</P><P>"The three years and four months that Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a stayed in Mah&#257;vana were the equivalent of five years for an ordinary child, and thus in that period He completed His kaum&#257;ra stage of childhood. The period from then to the age of six years and eight months, during which He lived in Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, constitutes His paugan&#803;d&#803;a stage. And the period from the age of six years and eight months through His tenth year, during which time He lived in Nand&#299;&#347;vara [Nandagr&#257;ma], constitutes His kai&#347;ora stage. Then, at the age of ten years and seven months, on the eleventh lunar day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra, He went to Mathur&#257;, and on the fourteenth day thereafter He killed Kam&#769;sa. Thus He completed His kai&#347;ora period at age ten, and He eternally remains at that age. In other words, we should understand that from this point on the Lord remains forever a ki&#347;ora."</P><P>Thus &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; analyzes the intricacies of this verse.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="2.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
