Upon hearing this news, Kam&#769;sa appeared with great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devak&#299;'s pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly snatched the child from Devak&#299;'s hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for Kam&#769;sa, however, the newborn child slipped away from his hands, rose above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of Durg&#257;. Durg&#257; then told Kam&#769;sa, "The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to persecute all the children will prove futile."</P><P>According to the prophecy, the eighth child of Devak&#299; would kill Kam&#769;sa, and therefore when Kam&#769;sa saw that the eighth child was a female and heard that his so-called enemy had taken birth elsewhere, he was struck with wonder. He decided to release Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities. Falling at the feet of Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of their children. Devak&#299; and Vasudeva, being naturally very pious, immediately excused Kam&#769;sa for his atrocities, and Kam&#769;sa, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home.</P><P>After the night passed, however, Kam&#769;sa called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The ministers, who were all demons, advised Kam&#769;sa that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Kam&#769;sa's kingdom should be killed. Although the demigods always feared Kam&#769;sa, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, Kam&#769;sa should try his best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that Kam&#769;sa and the demons continue their enmity toward Vis&#803;n&#803;u because Vis&#803;n&#803;u is the original person among all the demigods. The br&#257;hman&#803;as, the cows, the Vedas, austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts of the body of Vis&#803;n&#803;u, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva. Therefore, the ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the br&#257;hman&#803;as should be systematically persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, Kam&#769;sa approved of their instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the br&#257;hman&#803;as. Following Kam&#769;sa's orders, therefore, the demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabh&#363;mi.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../3/53.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
