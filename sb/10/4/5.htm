But kindly spare this daughter. Give her to me as your gift.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Here we see that Devak&#299; first focused Kam&#769;sa's attention on his atrocious activities, his killing of her many sons. Then she wanted to compromise with him by saying that whatever he had done was not his fault, but was ordained by destiny. Then she appealed to him to give her the daughter as a gift. Devak&#299; was the daughter of a ks&#803;atriya and knew how to play the political game. In politics there are different methods of achieving success: first repression (dama), then compromise (s&#257;ma), and then asking for a gift (d&#257;na). Devak&#299; first adopted the policy of repression by directly attacking Kam&#769;sa for having cruelly, atrociously killed her babies. Then she compromised by saying that this was not his fault, and then she begged for a gift. As we learn from the history of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, or "Greater India," the wives and daughters of the ruling class, the ks&#803;atriyas, knew the political game, but we never find that a woman was given the post of chief executive. This is in accordance with the injunctions of Manu-sam&#769;hit&#257;, but unfortunately Manu-sam&#769;hit&#257; is now being insulted, and the &#256;ryans, the members of Vedic society, cannot do anything. Such is the nature of Kali-yuga.</P><P>Nothing happens unless ordained by destiny.</P><P>tasyaiva hetoh&#803; prayateta kovido</P><P CLASS=n>na labhyate yad bhramat&#257;m upary adhah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>tal labhyate duh&#803;khavad anyatah&#803; sukham&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;lena sarvatra gabh&#299;ra-ram&#769;has&#257;</P><P>(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/5/18.htm">1.5.18</A>)</P><P>Devak&#299; knew very well that because the killing of her many children had been ordained by destiny, Kam&#769;sa was not to be blamed. There was no need to give good instructions to Kam&#769;sa. Upade&#347;o hi murkh&#257;n&#803;&#257;m&#769; prakop&#257;ya na &#347;&#257;ntaye (C&#257;n&#803;akya Pan&#803;d&#803;ita). If a foolish person is given good instructions, he becomes more and more angry. Moreover, a cruel person is more dangerous than a snake. A snake and a cruel person are both cruel, but a cruel person is more dangerous because although a snake can be charmed by mantras or subdued by herbs, a cruel person cannot be subdued by any means. Such was the nature of Kam&#769;sa.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
