Although their names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devak&#299; was able to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, whereas Ya&#347;od&#257; was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Ya&#347;od&#257; was such an advanced devotee that she never regarded Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own child. Devak&#299;, however, knew from the very beginning that although Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was her son, He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, no one regarded Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When something very wonderful happened because of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's activities, the inhabitants of Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana &#8212; the cowherd men, the cowherd boys, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, Ya&#347;od&#257; and the others &#8212; were surprised, but they never considered their son Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there as Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and intensely loves the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position. This is called kevala-bhakti and is distinct from the stages of j&#241;&#257;na and j&#241;&#257;namay&#299; bhakti.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Third Chapter, of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, entitled "The Birth of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../4/summary.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
