On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahm&#257; was one year on earth. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of yogam&#257;y&#257; no one could understand this but Balar&#257;ma.</P><P>After one moment of Brahm&#257;'s calculation, Brahm&#257; came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was his master, and he had played mischief for fun by taking away Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahm&#257; returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing with Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a in the same way as when he had come upon them; by Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's display of yogam&#257;y&#257;, the same pastimes were going on without any change.</P><P>On the day when Lord Brahm&#257; had first come, Baladeva could not go with Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and the cowherd boys, for it was His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called &#347;&#257;ntika-sn&#257;na. Therefore Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahm&#257; at that time. Now, one year later, Brahm&#257; returned, and because he returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse mentions that Brahm&#257; saw Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days earlier that Baladeva had inquired from Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but now, when Brahm&#257; returned, Brahm&#257; saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a as expansions of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord Brahm&#257; appeared there.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="39.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="41.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
