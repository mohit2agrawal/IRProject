He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form."</P><P>One description given of Brahman is satyam&#769; brahma, &#257;nanda-r&#363;pam: "Brahman is the Absolute Truth and complete &#257;nanda, or bliss." The forms of Vis&#803;n&#803;u, the Supreme Brahman, were one, but They were manifested differently. The followers of the Upanis&#803;ads, however, cannot understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This proves that Brahman and Param&#257;tm&#257; can actually he understood only through devotion, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam: bhakty&#257;ham ekay&#257; gr&#257;hyah&#803; (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/11/14/21.htm">11.14.21</A>). To establish that Brahman indeed has transcendental form, &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; T&#803;h&#257;kura gives various quotations from the &#347;&#257;stras. In the &#346;vet&#257;&#347;vatara Upanis&#803;ad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/3/8">3.8</A>), the Supreme is described as &#257;ditya-varn&#803;am&#769; tamasah&#803; parast&#257;t, "He whose self-manifest form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the darkness of ignorance." &#256;nanda-m&#257;tram ajaram&#769; pur&#257;n&#803;am ekam&#769; santam&#769; bahudh&#257; dr&#803;&#347;yam&#257;nam: "The Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of unhappiness. Although He is the oldest, He never ages, and although one, He is experienced in different forms." Sarve nity&#257;h&#803; &#347;&#257;&#347;vat&#257;&#347; ca deh&#257;s tasya par&#257;tmanah&#803;: "All the forms of that Supreme Person are eternal." (Mah&#257;-var&#257;ha Pur&#257;n&#803;a) The Supreme Person has a form, with hands and legs and other personal features, but His hands and legs are not material. Bhaktas know that the form of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, or Brahman, is not at all material. Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one is absorbed in it, being fully developed in bhakti, one can understand Him (prem&#257;&#241;jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/38.htm">Bs. 5.38</A>]). The M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299;s, however, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it is material.</P><P>Transcendental forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His person are so great that the impersonal followers of the Upanis&#803;ads cannot reach the platform of knowledge to understand them. Particularly, the transcendental forms of the Lord are beyond the reach of the impersonalists, who can only understand, through the studies of the Upanis&#803;ads, that the Absolute Truth is not matter and that the Absolute Truth is not materially restricted by limited potency.</P><P>Yet although Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a cannot be seen through the Upanis&#803;ads, in some places it is said that Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a can in fact be known in this way. Aupanis&#803;adam&#769; purus&#803;am: "He is known by the Upanis&#803;ads." This means that when one is purified by Vedic knowledge, one is then allowed to enter into devotional understanding (mad-bhaktim&#769; labhate par&#257;m [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/18/54.htm">Bg. 18.54</A>]).</P><P>tac chraddadh&#257;n&#257; munayo</P><P CLASS=n>j&#241;&#257;na-vairagya-yuktay&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>pa&#347;yanty &#257;tmani c&#257;tm&#257;nam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>bhakty&#257; &#347;ruta-gr&#803;h&#299;tay&#257;</P><P>"The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Ved&#257;nta-&#347;ruti." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/2/12.htm">1.2.12</A>) The word &#347;ruta-gr&#803;h&#299;tay&#257; refers to Ved&#257;nta knowledge, not sentimentality. &#346;ruta-gr&#803;h&#299;ta is sound knowledge.</P><P>Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, Brahm&#257; thus realized, is the reservoir of all truth, knowledge and bliss. He is the combination of these three transcendental features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the Upanis&#803;ads. Brahm&#257; realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Vis&#803;n&#803;u forms were not transformed by mysticism of the type that a yog&#299; or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and boys transformed into vis&#803;n&#803;u-m&#363;rtis, or Vis&#803;n&#803;u forms, were not displays of vis&#803;n&#803;u-m&#257;y&#257;, or Vis&#803;n&#803;u energy, but were Vis&#803;n&#803;u Himself. The respective qualifications of Vis&#803;n&#803;u and vis&#803;n&#803;u-m&#257;y&#257; are just like those of fire and heat. In heat there is the qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The manifestation of the Vis&#803;n&#803;u forms of the boys, cows and calves was not like the heat, but rather like the fire &#8212; they were all actually Vis&#803;n&#803;u. Factually, the qualification of Vis&#803;n&#803;u is full truth, full knowledge and full bliss. Another example may be given with material objects, which may be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in many waterpots, but the reflections of the sun in many pots are not actually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the pot, although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a assumed was fully Vis&#803;n&#803;u.</P><P>We should discuss &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam daily as much as possible, and then everything will be clarified, for Bh&#257;gavatam is the essence of all Vedic literature (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam&#769; phalam [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/1/3.htm">SB 1.1.3</A>]). It was written by Vy&#257;sadeva (mah&#257;-muni-kr&#803;te) when he was self-realized. Thus the more we read &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, the more its knowledge becomes clear. Each and every verse is transcendental.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="53.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="55.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
