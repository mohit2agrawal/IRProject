Thus he challenged Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a with the following message: "Since I alone am the true Personality of Godhead, You should give up Your false claim to this position, as well as my divine symbols, and take shelter of me. If You do not, then prepare for battle."</P><P>When Ugrasena and the members of his royal assembly heard Paun&#803;d&#803;raka's foolish boast, they all laughed heartily. &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a then told Paun&#803;d&#803;raka's messenger to convey a message to his master: "O fool, I will force you to give up the so-called Sudar&#347;ana disc and the other divine symbols of Mine you have dared to assume. And when you lie down on the battlefield, you will become the shelter of dogs."</P><P>Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a then went to K&#257;&#347;&#299;. Paun&#803;d&#803;raka, seeing the Lord preparing for battle, quickly came out of the city to confront Him with his army. His friend K&#257;&#347;ir&#257;ja followed him, leading the rear guard. Just as the fire of universal devastation destroys every living being in all directions, so Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a annihilated the armies of Paun&#803;d&#803;raka and K&#257;&#347;ir&#257;ja. Then, after chastising Paun&#803;d&#803;raka, the Lord beheaded both him and K&#257;&#347;ir&#257;ja with His Sudar&#347;ana disc. Thereafter, He returned to Dv&#257;rak&#257;. Because Paun&#803;d&#803;raka had constantly meditated on the Supreme Lord, even dressing like Him, he gained liberation.</P><P>When Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a beheaded K&#257;&#347;ir&#257;ja, the King's head flew into his city, and when his queens, sons and other relatives saw it, they all began to lament. At that time a son of K&#257;&#347;ir&#257;ja's named Sudaks&#803;in&#803;a, wanting to avenge his father' s death, began worshiping Lord &#346;iva with the intention of destroying his father's killer. Gratified by Sudaks&#803;in&#803;a's worship, Lord &#346;iva offered him a choice of benedictions, and Sudaks&#803;in&#803;a asked for a means to kill the one who had slain his father. Lord &#346;iva advised him to worship the Daks&#803;in&#803;&#257;gni fire with black magic rituals. This Sudaks&#803;in&#803;a did, with the result that a fearsome demon with a body of flames appeared from the pit of the sacrificial fire. The demon rose up carrying a fiery trident and at once set off for Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>The residents of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's capital became terrified as the demon approached the city, but Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a assured them of protection and dispatched His Sudar&#347;ana cakra to oppose the magic creation of Lord &#346;iva. The Sudar&#347;ana overpowered the demon, who then returned to V&#257;r&#257;n&#803;as&#299; and burned Sudaks&#803;in&#803;a to ashes, together with his priests. The Sudar&#347;ana disc, following the demon, entered V&#257;r&#257;n&#803;as&#299; and burned the entire city to the ground. Then the Lord's disc returned to His side in Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../65/34.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
