Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can't give up talking about Him.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, &#346;r&#299;la Prabhup&#257;da explains the meaning of this verse as follows: "[&#346;r&#299;mat&#299; R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#803;&#299; said to the bee,] 'You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a &#8212; how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have heard this from Our grandmother Paurn&#803;am&#257;s&#299;. She has informed Us that Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was born in a ks&#803;atriya family previous to this birth and was known as R&#257;macandra. In that birth, instead of killing V&#257;l&#299;, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a ks&#803;atriya, He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord R&#257;macandra, as a ks&#803;atriya, should have fought with V&#257;l&#299; face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a ks&#803;atriya. Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of S&#299;t&#257; that He converted &#346;&#363;rpan&#803;akh&#257;, the sister of R&#257;van&#803;a, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. &#346;&#363;rpan&#803;akh&#257; proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a ks&#803;atriya He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget S&#299;t&#257;-dev&#299; and converted &#346;&#363;rpan&#803;akh&#257; into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a ks&#803;atriya, He took birth as a br&#257;hman&#803;a boy known as V&#257;manadeva and asked charity from Bali Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. Bali was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a as V&#257;manadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the P&#257;t&#257;la kingdom. We know all about Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: In spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.'
