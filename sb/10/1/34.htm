Even if Kam&#769;sa were to see that the eighth child of Devak&#299; was a daughter, he should have no doubt that the eighth child was to kill him. According to the Vi&#347;va-ko&#347;a dictionary, the word garbha means "embryo" and also arbhaka, or "child." Kam&#769;sa was affectionate toward his sister, and therefore he had become the chariot driver to carry her and his brother-in-law to their home. The demigods, however, did not want Kam&#769;sa to be affectionate toward Devak&#299;, and therefore, from an unseen position, they encouraged Kam&#769;sa to offend her. Moreover, the six sons of Mar&#299;ci had been cursed to take birth from the womb of Devak&#299;, and upon being killed by Kam&#769;sa they would be delivered. When Devak&#299; understood that Kam&#769;sa would be killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who would appear from her womb, she felt great joy. The word vahase is also significant because it indicates that the ominous vibration condemned Kam&#769;sa for acting just like a beast of burden by carrying his enemy's mother.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="33.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="35.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
