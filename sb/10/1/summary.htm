This chapter describes how Kam&#769;sa, frightened by hearing an omen about his being killed by the eighth son of Devak&#299;, killed Devak&#299;'s sons one after another.</P><P>When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; finished describing the dynasty of Yadu, as well as the dynasties of the moon-god and sun-god, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it requested him to describe Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, who appeared with Baladeva in the Yadu dynasty, and how Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a performed His activities within this world. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is transcendental, the King said, and therefore to understand His activities is the occupation of liberated persons. Hearing of kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a-l&#299;l&#257; is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Except for an animal killer or one who is following a policy of suicide, every intelligent person must strive to understand Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and His activities.</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was the only worshipable Deity for the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it was in the womb of his mother, Uttar&#257;, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a saved him from the attack of the brahma-&#347;astra. Now Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; how His Lordship Baladeva, the son of Rohin&#803;&#299;, could have appeared in the womb of Devak&#299;. Why did Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a transfer Himself from Mathur&#257; to Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, King Par&#299;ks&#803;it asked, and how did He live there with His family members? What did Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a do in Mathur&#257; and Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, and why did He kill His maternal uncle Kam&#769;sa? For how many years did Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a reside in Dv&#257;rak&#257;, and how many queens did He have? Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; all these questions. He also requested &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to describe other activities of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a about which he could not inquire.</P><P>When &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; began to speak about Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it forgot the fatigue brought about by his fasting. Enthusiastic to describe Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; said, "Like the waters of the Ganges, descriptions of the activities of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a can purify the entire universe. The speaker, the inquirer and the audience all become purified."</P><P>Once when the entire world was overburdened by the increasing military power of demons in the form of kings, mother earth assumed the shape of a cow and approached Lord Brahm&#257; for relief, Sympathetic to mother earth's lamentation, Brahm&#257;, accompanied by Lord &#346;iva and other demigods, took the cow-shaped mother earth to the shore of the milk ocean, where he offered prayers to please Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, who lay there on an island in transcendental ecstasy. Brahm&#257; thereafter understood the advice of Mah&#257;-Vis&#803;n&#803;u, who informed him that He would appear on the surface of the earth to mitigate the burden created by the demons. The demigods, along with their wives, should appear there as associates of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a in the family of Yadu to increase the sons and grandsons in that dynasty. By the will of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Anantadeva would appear first, as Balar&#257;ma, and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's potency, yogam&#257;y&#257;, would also appear. Brahm&#257; informed mother earth about all this, and then he returned to his own abode.</P><P>After marrying Devak&#299;, Vasudeva was returning home with her on a chariot driven by Kam&#769;sa, her brother, when an ominous voice addressed Kam&#769;sa, warning him that Devak&#299;'s eighth son would kill him. Upon hearing this omen, Kam&#769;sa was immediately ready to kill Devak&#299;, but Vasudeva diplomatically began to instruct him. Vasudeva stressed that it would not be good for Kam&#769;sa to kill his younger sister, especially at the time of her marriage. Anyone who possesses a material body must die, Vasudeva advised him. Every living entity lives in a body for some time and then transmigrates to another body, but one is unfortunately misled into accepting the body as the soul. If a person under this mistaken conception wants to kill another body, he is condemned as hellish.</P><P>Because Kam&#769;sa was not satisfied by Vasudeva's instructions, Vasudeva devised a plan. He offered to bring Kam&#769;sa all of Devak&#299;'s children so that Kam&#769;sa could kill them. Why then should Kam&#769;sa kill Devak&#299; now? Kam&#769;sa was satisfied by this proposal. In due course of time, when Devak&#299; gave birth to a child, Vasudeva brought the newborn baby to Kam&#769;sa, who, upon seeing Vasudeva's magnanimity, was struck with wonder. When Vasudeva gave Kam&#769;sa the child, Kam&#769;sa, showing some intelligence, said that since he was to be killed by the eighth child, why should he kill the first? Although Vasudeva did not trust him, Kam&#769;sa requested Vasudeva to take the child back. Later, however, after N&#257;rada approached Kam&#769;sa and disclosed to him that the demigods were appearing in the Yadu and Vr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;i dynasties and conspiring to kill him, Kam&#769;sa decided to kill all the children born in these families, and he also decided that any child born from the womb of Devak&#299; must be killed. Thus he arrested and imprisoned both Devak&#299; and Vasudeva and killed six of their sons, one after another. N&#257;rada had also informed Kam&#769;sa that in his previous birth Kam&#769;sa was K&#257;lanemi, a demon killed by Vis&#803;n&#803;u. Consequently, Kam&#769;sa became a great enemy to all the descendants of the yadu-vam&#769;&#347;a, the Yadu dynasty. He even arrested and imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena, for Kam&#769;sa wanted to enjoy the kingdom alone.</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a has threefold pastimes &#8212; the Vraja-l&#299;l&#257;, M&#257;thura-l&#299;l&#257; and Dv&#257;rak&#257;-l&#299;l&#257;. As already mentioned, in the Tenth Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam there are ninety chapters, which describe all these l&#299;l&#257;s. The first four chapters describe Brahm&#257;'s prayers for the relief of the earth's burden, and they also describe the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Chapters Five through Thirty-nine recount Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's pastimes in Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana. The Fortieth Chapter describes how Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a enjoyed in the water of the Yamun&#257; and how Akr&#363;ra offered prayers. Chapters Forty-one through Fifty-one, eleven chapters, tell of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's pastimes in M&#257;thura, and Chapters Fifty-two through Ninety, thirty-nine chapters, relate Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's pastimes in Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>Chapters Twenty-nine through Thirty-three describe Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's dancing with the gop&#299;s, known as the r&#257;sa-l&#299;l&#257;. Therefore these five chapters are known as r&#257;sa-pa&#241;c&#257;dhy&#257;ya. The Forty-seventh Chapter of the Tenth Canto is a description known as the bhramara-g&#299;t&#257;.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../../9/24/67.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
