Yet the devotees of Vis&#803;n&#803;u are generally poverty-stricken, while &#346;iva's attain abundant wealth. When Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it asked &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; to explain this puzzling fact, the sage replied as follows: "Lord &#346;iva manifests as false ego in three varieties, according to the three modes of nature. From this false ego arise the five physical elements and the other transformations of material nature, totaling sixteen. When a devotee of Lord &#346;iva worships his manifestation in any of these elements, the devotee obtains all sorts of corresponding enjoyable opulences. But because Lord &#346;r&#299; Hari is transcendental to the modes of material nature, His devotees also become transcendental."</P><P>At the end of the performance of his A&#347;vamedha sacrifices, King Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira had asked this same question of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, who replied, "When I feel special compassion for someone, I gradually deprive him of his wealth. Then the poverty-stricken man's children, wife and other relations all abandon him. When he again tries to acquire wealth in order to win back his family's favor, I mercifully frustrate him so that he becomes disgusted with fruitive work and befriends My devotees. And at that time I bestow upon him My extraordinary grace; then he can become freed from the bondage of material life and attain to the kingdom of God, Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha."</P><P>Lord Brahm&#257;, Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u and Lord &#346;iva can each bestow or withhold favors, but whereas Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva are satisfied or angered very quickly, Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is not. In this regard the Vedic literature relates the following account: Once the demon Vr&#803;ka asked N&#257;rada which god was most quickly pleased, and N&#257;rada answered that Lord &#346;iva was. Thus Vr&#803;k&#257;sura went to the holy place of Ked&#257;ran&#257;tha and began worshiping Lord &#346;iva by offering pieces of his own flesh as oblations into the fire. But &#346;iva did not appear. So Vr&#803;ka decided to commit suicide by cutting off his head. Just at the critical moment, Lord &#346;iva appeared from the sacrificial fire and stopped him, offering the demon whatever boon he chose. Vr&#803;ka said, "May death come to whomever I touch upon the head with my hand." Lord &#346;iva was obliged to fulfill this request, and at once the wicked Vr&#803;ka tried to test the benediction by putting his hand on the lord's head. Terrified, &#346;iva fled for his life, running as far as heaven and the outer limits of the mortal world. Finally the lord reached the planet of &#346;vetadv&#299;pa, where Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u resides. Seeing the desperate &#346;iva from afar, the Lord disguised Himself as a young student and went before Vr&#803;k&#257;sura. In a sweet voice he addressed the demon: "My dear Vr&#803;ka, please rest awhile and tell Us what you intend to do." Vr&#803;ka was charmed by the Lord's words and revealed everything that had happened. The Lord said, "Ever since Lord &#346;iva was cursed by Praj&#257;pati Daks&#803;a, he has become just like a carnivorous hobgoblin. So you shouldn't trust his word. Better to test his benediction by putting your hand on your own head." Bewildered by these words, the foolish demon touched his own head, which immediately shattered and fell to the ground. Cries of "Victory!" "Obeisances!" and "Well done!" were heard from the sky, and the demigods, sages, celestial forefathers and Gandharvas all congratulated the Supreme Lord by raining down flowers upon Him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../87/50.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
