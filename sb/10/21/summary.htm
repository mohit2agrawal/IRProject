The gop&#299;s heard the enchanting flute-song and understood that Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was entering the forest. Then they narrated to each other the Lord's various activities.</P><P>The gop&#299;s declared, "To see Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a playing His flute while taking the cows to pasture is the highest perfection for the eyes. What pious activities has this flute performed that enable him to freely drink the nectar of &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's lips &#8212; a blessing we cowherd girls find difficult to achieve? Hearing the song of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's flute, the peacocks dance, and all the other creatures become stunned when they see them. Demigoddesses traveling through the sky in their airplanes are vexed by Cupid, and their garments become loose. The ears of the cows stand on end as they drink the nectar of this flute-song, and their calves simply stand stunned, the milk they have been drinking from their mothers' udders still in their mouths. The birds take shelter of the branches of the trees and close their eyes, listening to the song of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's flute with rapt attention. The flowing rivers become perturbed by conjugal attraction for Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and, stopping their flow, embrace Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's lotus feet with the arms of their waves, while the clouds serve as parasols to shade Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's head from the hot sun. The aborigine women of the &#346;abara race, seeing the grass stained by the red ku&#324;kuma adorning the Lord's lotus feet, smear this vermilion powder upon their breasts and faces to alleviate the distress created by Cupid. Govardhana Hill offers grass and various kinds of fruits and bulbous roots in worship of Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. All the nonmoving living beings take on the characteristics of moving creatures, and the moving living beings become stationary. These things are all very wonderful."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../20/49.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
