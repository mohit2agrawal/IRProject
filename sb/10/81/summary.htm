I regard as very significant even the smallest offering from My loving devotee." But the poor br&#257;hman&#803;a was ashamed to present Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a with his meager gift of flat rice. However, since Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is the Supersoul dwelling in all hearts, He knew why Sud&#257;m&#257; had come to visit Him. So He grabbed the bundle of flat rice Sud&#257;m&#257; was hiding and ate a handful of it with great pleasure. He was about to eat a second morsel when Rukmin&#803;&#299; dev&#299; stopped Him.</P><P>Feeling as if he had gone back to Godhead, Sud&#257;m&#257; spent that night comfortably in Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's palace, and the next morning he set off for home. As he passed along the highway, he thought of how fortunate he was to have been so honored by &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. Absorbed in this meditation, Sud&#257;m&#257; arrived at the place where his home used to be &#8212; and he was struck with great wonder. Instead of his broken-down hovel, he saw a series of opulent palaces. While he stood astonished, a group of beautiful men and women came forward to greet him with singing and music. The br&#257;hman&#803;a's wife, wonderfully adorned with celestial jewelry, came out of the palace and welcomed him with great love and reverence. Sud&#257;m&#257; entered his home together with her, thinking that this extraordinary transformation must have been due to the Supreme Lord's mercy on him.</P><P>From then on Sud&#257;m&#257; lived his life amidst lavish wealth, yet he maintained his mood of detachment and constantly chanted the glories of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a In a short time he broke off all bonds of bodily attachment and attained to the kingdom of God.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../80/45.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1-2.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
