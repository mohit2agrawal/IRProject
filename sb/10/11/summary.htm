Being surprised, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's father, Nanda, and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they saw the fallen trees and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a standing between them, bound to the ul&#363;khala, the wooden mortar. They could find no cause for the trees' having fallen and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's being there. They thought this might be the work of some other asura who had met Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a about how the whole incident had taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many wonderful incidents in connection with Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. Anyway, Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja immediately released Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a from the ropes.</P><P>In this way, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, at every day and every moment, displayed wonderful incidents to increase the parental affection of Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Ya&#347;od&#257;, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the yamala-arjunas was one of these wonderful pastimes.</P><P>One day a fruit vendor approached Nanda Mah&#257;r&#257;ja's house, and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a gathered some food grains with His little palms and went to the vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains fell from His palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in exchange for as much fruit as Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and jewels.</P><P>Thereafter, all the elderly gopas decided to leave Gokula because they saw that in Gokula there was always some disturbance. They decided to go to Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, Vraja-dh&#257;ma, and the next day they all departed. In Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, both Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and Balar&#257;ma, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send them to the pasturing grounds (go-caran&#803;a). During this time, a demon named Vats&#257;sura entered among the calves and was killed, and another asura, in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a narrated all these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's playmates, but because of full affection they enjoyed these narrations of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's activities.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../10/43.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
