While playing happily in Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, Lord Baladeva climbed up on the shoulders of the demon Pralamba and struck his head with His fist, destroying him.</P><P>&#346;r&#299; Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, where Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and Balar&#257;ma enacted Their pastimes, was even during the summer decorated with all the qualities of spring. At that time Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a would become absorbed in various sports, surrounded by Balar&#257;ma and all the cowherd boys. One day they were intently dancing, singing and playing when a demon named Pralamba entered their midst, disguised as a cowherd boy. The omniscient Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a saw through the disguise, but even as He thought of how to kill the demon, He treated him as a friend.</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a then suggested to His young friends and Baladeva that they play a game involving contending parties. Taking the role of leaders, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and Balar&#257;ma divided the boys into two groups and determined that the losers would have to carry the winners on their shoulders. Thus when &#346;r&#299;d&#257;m&#257; and Vr&#803;s&#803;abha, members of Balar&#257;ma's party, were victorious, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and another boy in His party carried them on their shoulders. Pralamb&#257;sura thought that the unconquerable Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a would be too great an opponent to contend with, so the demon fought with Balar&#257;ma instead and was defeated. Taking Lord Balar&#257;ma on his back, Pralamb&#257;sura began to walk away very swiftly. But Balar&#257;ma became as heavy as Mount Sumeru, and the demon, unable to carry Him, had to reveal his true, demoniac form. When Balar&#257;ma saw this terrible form, He struck the demon a ferocious blow on the head with His fist. This blow shattered Pralamb&#257;sura's head just as lightning bolts hurled by the king of the demigods shatter mountains. The demon repeatedly vomited blood and then fell upon the ground. When the cowherd boys saw Lord Balar&#257;ma return, they joyfully embraced and congratulated Him as the demigods showered garlands of flowers from the heavens and glorified Him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../17/25.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
