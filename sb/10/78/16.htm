"Then, hearing that &#346;i&#347;up&#257;la had been killed, Dantavakra went to Mathur&#257; to fight against Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. When Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, moreover, heard of this, He mounted His chariot and went to Mathur&#257;."</P><P>Tayor dantavakra-v&#257;sudevayor aho-r&#257;tram&#769; mathur&#257;-dv&#257;ri sa&#324;gr&#257;mah&#803; samavartata. kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;as tu gaday&#257; tam&#769; jagh&#257;na. sa tu c&#363;rn&#803;ita-sarv&#257;&#324;go vajra-nirbhinno mah&#299;dhara iva gat&#257;sur avani-tale nipap&#257;ta. so 'pi hareh&#803; s&#257;r&#363;pyen&#803;a yogi-gamyam&#769; nity&#257;nanda-sukha-dam&#769; &#347;&#257;&#347;vatam&#769; paramam&#769; padam av&#257;pa: "Between the two of them &#8212; Dantavakra and Lord V&#257;sudeva &#8212; there then began a battle at the gate of Mathur&#257; that lasted all day and night. Finally Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a struck Dantavakra with His club, at which point Dantavakra fell lifeless to the ground, all his limbs smashed like a mountain shattered by a lightning bolt. Dantavakra achieved the liberation of gaining a form equal to the Lord's, and thus he also achieved the Lord's eternal, supreme abode, attainable by perfect yog&#299;s, which bestows the happiness of everlasting spiritual bliss."</P><P>Ittham&#769; jaya-vijayau sanak&#257;di-&#347;&#257;pa-vy&#257;jena kevalam&#769; bhagavato l&#299;l&#257;rtham&#769; sam&#769;sr&#803;t&#257;v avat&#299;rya janma-traye 'pi tenaiva nihatau janma-tray&#257;vas&#257;ne muktim av&#257;ptau: "So it was that Jaya and Vijaya &#8212; apparently because of being cursed by Sanaka and his brothers but actually to facilitate the Supreme Lord's pastimes &#8212; descended to this material world and in three consecutive lifetimes were killed by the Lord Himself. Then, at the completion of these three lifetimes, they attained liberation."</P><P>In this passage of the Padma Pur&#257;n&#803;a the words kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;as tu tac chrutv&#257;, "when Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a heard of this," indicate that the Lord heard from N&#257;rada, who travels as swiftly as the mind, that Dantavakra had gone to Mathur&#257;. Therefore immediately after killing &#346;&#257;lva, without first entering Dv&#257;rak&#257;, the Lord reached the vicinity of Mathur&#257; in a single moment on His chariot, which also moves as swiftly as the mind, and there He saw Dantavakra. Thus it is that even today, by the gate of Mathur&#257; facing the direction of Dv&#257;rak&#257;, there is a village known in the vernacular as Datih&#257;, a name derived from the Sanskrit dantavakra-ha, "killer of Dantavakra." This village was founded by Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's great-grandson Vajra.</P><P>In the same section of the Padma Pur&#257;n&#803;a, these statements follow: kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;o 'pi tam&#769; hatv&#257; yamun&#257;m utt&#299;rya nanda-vrajam&#769; gatv&#257; sotkan&#803;t&#803;hau pitar&#257;v abhiv&#257;dy&#257;&#347;v&#257;sya t&#257;bhy&#257;m&#769; s&#257;&#347;ru-sekam &#257;li&#324;gitah&#803; sakala-gopa-vr&#803;ddh&#257;n pran&#803;amya bahu-vastr&#257;bharan&#803;&#257;dibhis tatra-sth&#257;n santarpay&#257;m &#257;sa. "And after killing him [ Vid&#363;ratha], Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a crossed the Yamun&#257; and went to the cowherd village of Nanda, where He honored and consoled His aggrieved parents. They drenched Him with tears and embraced Him, and then the Lord offered obeisances to the elder cowherd men and gratified all the residents with abundant gifts of clothing, ornaments and so on."</P><P>k&#257;lindy&#257;h&#803; puline ramye</P><P CLASS=n>pun&#803;ya-vr&#803;ks&#803;a-sam&#257;cite</P><P CLASS=n>gopa-n&#257;r&#299;bhir ani&#347;am&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>kr&#299;d&#803;ay&#257;m &#257;sa ke&#347;avah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>ramya-keli-sukhenaiva</P><P CLASS=n>gopa-ve&#347;a-dharah&#803; prabhuh&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>bahu-prema-rasen&#257;tra</P><P CLASS=n>m&#257;sa-dvayam uv&#257;sa ha</P><P>"Lord Ke&#347;ava sported continuously with the cowherd women on the K&#257;lind&#299;'s charming bank, which was filled with pious trees. Thus the Supreme Lord, assuming the appearance of a cowherd, resided there for two months, enjoying the pleasure of intimate pastimes in various moods of loving reciprocation."</P><P>Atha tatra-sth&#257; nanda-gop&#257;dayah&#803; sarve jan&#257;h&#803; putra-d&#257;r&#257;di-sahit&#257; v&#257;sudeva-pras&#257;dena divya-r&#363;pa-dhar&#257; vim&#257;nam &#257;r&#363;d&#803;h&#257;h&#803; paramam&#769; vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha-lokam av&#257;puh&#803;. kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;as tu nanda-gopa-vrajaukas&#257;m&#769; sarves&#803;&#257;m&#769; nir&#257;mayam&#769; sva-padam&#769; dattv&#257; divi deva-gan&#803;aih&#803; sam&#769;st&#363;yam&#257;no dv&#257;ravat&#299;m&#769; vive&#347;a: "Then, by Lord V&#257;sudeva's grace, Nanda and all the other residents of that place, together with their children and wives, assumed their eternal, spiritual forms, boarded a celestial airplane and ascended to the supreme Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha planet [Goloka Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana]. Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, however, after bestowing on Nanda Gopa and all the other inhabitants of Vraja His own transcendental abode, which is free of all disease, traveled through the sky and returned to Dv&#257;rak&#257; as demigods chanted His praises."</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; comments as follows on this passage in his Laghu-bh&#257;gavat&#257;mr&#803;ta (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/bhagavatamrta/1/488">1.488-89</A>):</P><P>vraje&#347;&#257;der am&#769;&#347;a-bh&#363;t&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>ye dron&#803;&#257;dy&#257; av&#257;taran</P><P CLASS=n>kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;as t&#257;n eva vaikun&#803;t&#803;he</P><P CLASS=n>pr&#257;hin&#803;od iti s&#257;mpratam</P><P CLASS=n>pres&#803;t&#803;hebhyo 'pi priyatamair</P><P CLASS=n>janair gokula-v&#257;sibhih&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>vr&#803;nd&#257;ran&#803;ye sadaiv&#257;sau</P><P CLASS=n>vih&#257;ram&#769; kurute harih&#803;</P><P>"Since Dron&#803;a and other demigods had previously descended to earth to merge as partial expansions into the King of Vraja and other devotees of Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, at this time it was these demigod expansions whom Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a sent off to Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha. Lord Hari is perpetually enjoying pastimes in Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana with His intimate devotees, the residents of Gokula, who are dearer to Him than even His most dear other devotees."</P><P>In the passage of the Padma Pur&#257;n&#803;a, the word putra in the phrase nanda-gop&#257;dayah&#803; sarve jan&#257;h&#803; putra-d&#257;r&#257;di-sahit&#257;h&#803; ("Nanda Gopa and the others, together with their children and wives") refers to such sons as Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, &#346;r&#299;d&#257;m&#257; and Subala, while the word d&#257;ra refers to such wives as &#346;r&#299; Ya&#347;od&#257; and K&#299;rtid&#257;, the mother of R&#257;dh&#257;r&#257;n&#803;&#299;. The phrase sarve jan&#257;h&#803; ("all the people") refers to everyone living in the district of Vraja. Thus they all went to the topmost Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha planet, Goloka. The phrase divya-r&#363;pa-dhar&#257;h&#803; indicates that in Goloka they engage in pastimes appropriate to demigods, not those suited to humans, as in Gokula. Just as during Lord R&#257;macandra's incarnation the residents of Ayodhy&#257; were transported to Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha in their selfsame bodies, so in this incarnation of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a the residents of Vraja attained to Goloka in theirs.</P><P>Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's journey from Dv&#257;rak&#257; to Vraja is confirmed by the following passage of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../1/11/9.htm">1.11.9</A>): yarhy ambuj&#257;ks&#803;&#257;pasas&#257;ra bho bhav&#257;n kur&#363;n madh&#363;n v&#257;tha suhr&#803;d-didr&#803;ks&#803;ay&#257;/ tatr&#257;bda-kot&#803;i-pratimah&#803; ks&#803;an&#803;o bhavet. "O lotus-eyed Lord, whenever You go away to Mathur&#257;, Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana or Hastin&#257;pura to meet Your friends and relatives, every moment of Your absence seems like a million years." Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a had been harboring a desire to go see His friends and relatives in Vraja ever since Lord Baladeva had gone there, but His mother, father and other elders in Dv&#257;rak&#257; had refused to give Him permission. Now, however, after the killing of &#346;&#257;lva, when Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a heard from N&#257;rada that Dantavakra had gone to Mathur&#257;, no one could object to the Lord's going there immediately without first entering Dv&#257;rak&#257;. And after killing Dantavakra, He would have the opportunity to meet with His friends and relatives living in Vraja.</P><P>Thinking like this, and also remembering Uddhava's allusion to the gop&#299;s in the words g&#257;yanti te vi&#347;ada-karma (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/10/71/9.htm">10.71.9</A>), He went to Vraja, dispelling the feelings of separation of the inhabitants. For two months Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a enjoyed in Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana just as before, previous to His leaving there to kill Kam&#769;sa in Mathur&#257;. Then, at the end of two months, He withdrew His Vraja pastimes from mundane eyes by taking the demigod portions of His parents and other relatives and friends to Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha. Thus, in one complete plenary manifestation He went to Goloka in the spiritual world, in another He remained perpetually enjoying in Vraja while invisible to material eyes, and in yet another He mounted His chariot and returned alone to Dv&#257;rak&#257;. The people of &#346;aurasena province thought that after killing Dantavakra Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a had paid a visit to His parents and other dear ones and now was returning to Dv&#257;rak&#257;. The people of Vraja, on the other hand, could not understand where He had suddenly disappeared to, and so they were totally astonished.</P><P>Furthermore, &#346;ukadeva considered that Par&#299;ks&#803;it Mah&#257;r&#257;ja might think, "How is it that the same Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a who caused the cowherds to attain Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha in their selfsame bodies also caused the residents of Dv&#257;rak&#257; to attain such an inauspicious condition in the course of His maus&#803;ala-l&#299;l&#257;?" Thus the King might consider the arrangement unfair because of his own affinity for the Yadus. That is why &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not allow him to hear this pastime, which, as mentioned above, is related in the Uttara-khan&#803;d&#803;a of &#346;r&#299; Padma Pur&#257;n&#803;a.</P><P>In &#346;r&#299; Vais&#803;n&#803;ava-tos&#803;an&#803;&#299;, San&#257;tana Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s commentary on the Tenth Canto, we find the following sequential list of pastimes: First was the journey on the occasion of the solar eclipse, then the R&#257;jas&#363;ya assembly, then the gambling match and attempted disrobing of Draupad&#299;, then the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas' exile to the forest, then the killing of &#346;&#257;lva and Dantavakra, then Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's visit to Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, and finally the winding up of the Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana pastimes.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="13-15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
