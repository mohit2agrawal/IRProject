After the battle, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira was unhappy over such mass killings. Practically there was none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas. The only remaining hope was the child in the womb of his daughter-in-law, Uttar&#257;, and he was also attacked by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;, but by the grace of the Lord the child was saved. So after the settlement of all disturbing conditions and reestablishment of the peaceful order of the state, and after seeing the surviving child, Par&#299;ks&#803;it, well satisfied, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira felt some relief as a human being, although he had very little attraction for material happiness, which is always illusory and temporary.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
