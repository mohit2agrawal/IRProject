My lord, it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time [k&#257;la] that has approached us all.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>There is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death. No one wants to die, however acute the source of bodily sufferings may be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival of death served by cruel time, and no one can refuse to accept either summon calls or the supreme judgment of eternal time. This is explained before Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra because he might ask Vidura to find out some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation, as he had ordered many times before. Before ordering, however, Vidura informed Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra that there was no remedial measure by anyone or from any source in this material world. And because there is no such thing in the material world, death is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/10/34.htm">10.34</A>).</P><P>Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within this material world. Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu wanted to be immortal and underwent a severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled, and Brahm&#257; himself approached him to dissuade Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu from such a severe type of penance. Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu asked Brahm&#257; to award him the blessings of immortality, but Brahm&#257; said that he himself was subject to death, even in the topmost planet, so how could he award him the benediction of immortality? So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe, and what to speak of other planets, which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahmaloka, the residing planet of Brahm&#257;. Wherever there is the influence of eternal time, there is this set of tribulations, namely birth, disease, old age and death, and all of them are invincible.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="18.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="20.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
