A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. He was advised to leave home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching. To become narottama, or a first-class human being depending completely on the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, is not possible for any ordinary man. It is stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/7/28.htm">7.28</A>) that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Personality of Godhead. Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra was advised by Vidura at least to become a dh&#299;ra in the beginning if it were impossible for him to become a sanny&#257;s&#299; or a narottama. Persistently endeavoring on the line of self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a narottama from the stage of a dh&#299;ra. The dh&#299;ra stage is attained after prolonged practice of the yoga system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the dh&#299;ra stage, which is the preparatory stage for sanny&#257;sa. The sanny&#257;sa stage is the preparatory stage of paramaham&#769;sa, or the first-grade devotee of the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
