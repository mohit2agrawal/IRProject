After the Battle of Kuruks&#803;etra, the celebrated couple, having lost all their sons and grandsons, were under the care of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira. They were passing their days in great agony over such a heavy loss of life and were practically living the life of ascetics. The death news of Bh&#299;s&#803;madeva, uncle of Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra, was another great shock for the King and the Queen, and therefore they required solace from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Yudhis&#803;t&#803;hira was conscious of his duty, and he at once hurried to the spot with Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and satisfied the bereaved Dhr&#803;tar&#257;s&#803;t&#803;ra with kind words, from both himself and the Lord also.</P><P>G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; was a powerful ascetic, although she was living the life of a faithful wife and a kind mother. It is said that G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; also voluntarily closed her eyes because of the blindness of her husband. A wife's duty is to follow the husband cent percent. And G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299; was so true to her husband that she followed him even in his perpetual blindness. Therefore in her actions she was a great ascetic. Besides that, the shock she suffered because of the wholesale killing of her one hundred sons and her grandsons also was certainly too much for a woman. But she suffered all this just like an ascetic. G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;, although a woman, is no less than Bh&#299;s&#803;madeva in character. They are both remarkable personalities in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="49.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
