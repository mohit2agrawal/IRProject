Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; T&#803;h&#257;kura and &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299; do not believe that the King's action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangement was so made by the Lord just to call the King back home, back to Godhead.</P><P>According to &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299;, the plan was made by the will of the Lord, and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the King could be cursed by an inexperienced br&#257;hman&#803;a boy infected by the influence of Kali, and thus the King would leave his hearth and home for good. His connections with &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; would enable the presentation of the great &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, which is considered to be the book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, like His r&#257;sa-l&#299;la with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Vrajabh&#363;mi. This specific pastime of the Lord has a special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing Arjuna and the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas in frustration due to the intrigue of their cousin-brothers, the prelude of the Battle of Kuruks&#803;etra was created by the Lord. This was to incarnate the sound representative of the Lord, Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. So by placing King Par&#299;ks&#803;it in an awkward position, the incarnation of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by hunger and thirst was only a show, because the King endured much, even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the brahm&#257;stra released by A&#347;vatth&#257;m&#257;. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it are powerful enough to forbear such distresses, by the will of the Lord, and they are never disturbed. The situation, in this case, was therefore all planned by the Lord.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="32.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
