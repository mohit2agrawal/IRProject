All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In this particular stanza Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Personality of Godhead, is distinguished from other incarnations. He is counted amongst the avat&#257;ras (incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the Lord descends from His transcendental abode. Avat&#257;ra means "one who descends." All the incarnations of the Lord, including the Lord Himself, descend on the different planets of the material world as also in different species of life to fulfill particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himself, and sometimes His different plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, or His differentiated portions directly or indirectly empowered by Him, descend on this material world to execute certain specific functions. Originally the Lord is full of all opulences, all prowess, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation. When they are partly manifested through the plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, it should be noted that certain manifestations of His different powers are required for those particular functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayed, it does not mean that the electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same powerhouse can supply power to operate large-scale industrial dynamos with greater volts. Similarly, the incarnations of the Lord display limited powers because so much power is needed at that particular time.</P><P>For example, Lord Para&#347;ur&#257;ma and Lord Nr&#803;sim&#769;ha displayed unusual opulence by killing the disobedient ks&#803;atriyas twenty-one times and killing the greatly powerful atheist Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu. Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu was so powerful that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the unfavorable raising of his eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of material existence many, many times excel the most well-to-do human beings, in duration of life, beauty, wealth, paraphernalia, and in all other respects. Still they were afraid of Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu. Thus we can simply imagine how powerful Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu was in this material world. But even Hiran&#803;yaka&#347;ipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord Nr&#803;sim&#769;ha. This means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength of the Lord's nails. Similarly, J&#257;madagnya displayed the Lord's power to kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their respective states. The Lord's empowered incarnation N&#257;rada and plenary incarnation Var&#257;ha, as well as indirectly empowered Lord Buddha, created faith in the mass of people. The incarnations of R&#257;ma and Dhanvantari displayed His fame, and Balar&#257;ma, Mohin&#299; and V&#257;mana exhibited His beauty. Datt&#257;treya, Matsya, Kum&#257;ra and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara and N&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;a R&#803;s&#803;is exhibited His renunciation. So all the different incarnations of the Lord indirectly or directly manifested different features, but Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the primeval Lord, exhibited the complete features of Godhead, and thus it is confirmed that He is the source of all other incarnations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd girls. His pastimes with the gop&#299;s are all displays of transcendental existence, bliss and knowledge, although these are manifested apparently as sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the gop&#299;s should never be misunderstood. The Bh&#257;gavatam relates these transcendental pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in order to reach the position to understand the transcendental nature of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's pastimes with the gop&#299;s, the Bh&#257;gavatam promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos.</P><P>According to &#346;r&#299;la J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;'s statement, in accordance with authoritative sources, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is the source of all other incarnations. It is not that Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms of the Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and in the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; the Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word svayam is particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a has no other source than Himself. Although in other places the incarnations are described as bhagav&#257;n because of their specific functions, nowhere are they declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word svayam signifies the supremacy as the summum bonum.</P><P>The summum bonum Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is one without a second. He Himself has expanded Himself in various parts, portions and particles as svayam&#769;-r&#363;pa, svayam-prak&#257;&#347;a, tad-ek&#257;tm&#257;, pr&#257;bhava, vaibhava, vil&#257;sa, avat&#257;ra, &#257;ve&#347;a, and j&#299;vas, all provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective persons and personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully analyzed the summum bonum Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a to have sixty-four principal attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only some percentages of these attributes. But &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is the possessor of the attributes cent percent. And His personal expansions such as svayam-prak&#257;&#347;a, tad-ek&#257;tm&#257; up to the categories of the avat&#257;ras who are all vis&#803;n&#803;u-tattva, possess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord &#346;iva, who is neither avat&#257;ra nor &#257;ve&#347;a nor in between them, possesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But the j&#299;vas, or the individual living beings in different statuses of life, possess up to the limit of seventy-eight percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material existence, the living being possesses these attributes in very minute quantity, varying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect of living beings is Brahm&#257;, the supreme administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight percent of the attributes in full. All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantity, whereas human beings possess the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a human being is to develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being can never possess attributes like &#346;iva, Vis&#803;n&#803;u or Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can never become a God like &#346;iva, Vis&#803;n&#803;u or Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. He can become a Brahm&#257; in due course. The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dh&#257;ma and Mahe&#347;a-dh&#257;ma. The abode of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a above all spiritual planets is called Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;aloka or Goloka Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, and the perfected living being, by developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullness, can enter the planet of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;aloka after leaving the present material body.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
