When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sanny&#257;sa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vy&#257;sadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, "O my son!" Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The institution of varn&#803;a and &#257;&#347;rama prescribes many regulative duties to be observed by its followers. Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to study the Vedas must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are competent to study the Vedas from the &#257;c&#257;rya, or the bona fide spiritual master. &#346;r&#299; &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; did not undergo such purificatory ceremonies because he was a liberated soul from his very birth.</P><P>Generally, a man is born as an ordinary being, and by the purificatory processes he is born for the second time. When he sees a new light and seeks direction for spiritual progress, he approaches a spiritual master for instruction in the Vedas. The spiritual master accepts only the sincere inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man becomes twice-born, or a dvija. After qualifying as a dvija one may study the Vedas, and after becoming well versed in the Vedas one becomes a vipra. A vipra, or a qualified br&#257;hman&#803;a, thus realizes the Absolute and makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vais&#803;n&#803;ava stage. The Vais&#803;n&#803;ava stage is the postgraduate status of a br&#257;hman&#803;a. A progressive br&#257;hman&#803;a must necessarily become a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava, for a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava is a self-realized, learned br&#257;hman&#803;a.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava from the beginning; therefore, there was no need for him to undergo all the processes of the varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama institution. Ultimately the aim of varn&#803;&#257;&#347;rama-dharma is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lord, or a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava. Anyone, therefore, who becomes a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava accepted by the first-class Vais&#803;n&#803;ava, or uttama-adhik&#257;r&#299; Vais&#803;n&#803;ava, is already considered a br&#257;hman&#803;a, regardless of his birth or past deeds. &#346;r&#299; Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu accepted this principle and recognized &#346;r&#299;la Harid&#257;sa T&#803;h&#257;kura as the &#257;c&#257;rya of the holy name, although T&#803;h&#257;kura Harid&#257;sa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusion, &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was born a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava, and, therefore, brahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person &#8212; be he a Kir&#257;ta, H&#363;n&#803;a, &#256;ndhra, Pulinda, Pulka&#347;a, &#256;bh&#299;ra, &#346;umbha, Yavana, Khasa or even lower &#8212; can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vais&#803;n&#803;avas. &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; was the spiritual master of &#346;r&#299; S&#363;ta Gosv&#257;m&#299;, who therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto &#346;r&#299;la &#346;ukadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299; before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimis&#803;&#257;ran&#803;ya.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="3.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
