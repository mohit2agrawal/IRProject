Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Since it has been stated hereinbefore that in the Bh&#257;gavatam the Absolute Truth is to be known, the questions of the sages of Naimis&#803;&#257;ran&#803;ya are proper and just, because they pertain to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">15.15</A>) the Personality of Godhead says that in all the Vedas there is nothing but the urge for searching after Him, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. Thus the questions that pertain to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a are the sum and substance of all the Vedic inquiries.</P><P>The whole world is full of questions and answers. The birds, beasts and men are all busy in the matter of perpetual questions and answers. In the morning the birds in the nest become busy with questions and answers, and in the evening also the same birds come back and again become busy with questions and answers. The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night, is busy with questions and answers. The businessmen in the market are busy with questions and answers, and so also the lawyers in the court and the students in the schools and colleges. The legislators in the parliament are also busy with questions and answers, and the politicians and the press representatives are all busy with questions and answers. Although they go on making such questions and answers for their whole lives, they are not at all satisfied. Satisfaction of the soul can only be obtained by questions and answers on the subject of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a.</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is our most intimate master, friend, father or son and object of conjugal love. Forgetting Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, we have created so many objects of questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete satisfaction. All things &#8212; but Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a &#8212; give temporary satisfaction only, so if we are to have complete satisfaction we must take to the questions and answers about Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. We cannot live for a moment without being questioned or without giving answers. Because the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam deals with questions and answers that are related to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, we can derive the highest satisfaction only by reading and hearing this transcendental literature. One should learn the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam and make an all-around solution to all problems pertaining to social, political or religious matters. &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam and Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a are the sum total of all things.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="4.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="6.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
