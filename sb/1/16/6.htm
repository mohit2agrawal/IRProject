What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and His devotees are both on the transcendental plane; therefore the topics of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and of His pure devotees are equally good. The Battle of Kuruks&#803;etra is full of politics and diplomacy, but because the topics are related with Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; is therefore adored all over the world. There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners. To a pure devotee, who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things are transcendental if dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotees. We have heard and talked about the activities of the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas, and we now are dealing with the topics of Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it, but because all these topics are related to the Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, they are all transcendental, and pure devotees have great interest in hearing them. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bh&#299;s&#803;madeva.</P><P>Our duration of life is not very long, and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave everything for the next stage. Thus it is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics which are not related with Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth hearing if it is devoid of its relation to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a.</P><P>The spiritual planet, Goloka Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, the eternal abode of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, is shaped like the whorl of a lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting His own abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of the lotus flower. His feet are also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said that Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a has lotus feet.</P><P>A living being is eternal by constitution. He is, so to speak, in the whirlpool of birth and death due to his contact with material energy. Freed from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. Those who want to live forever without changing their material bodies should not waste valuable time with topics other than those relating to Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and His devotees.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="5.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="7.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
