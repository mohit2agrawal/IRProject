By punishing them, he teaches the citizens to obey the laws of the state. Again, you have said that punishing a person who is deaf and dumb is like chewing the chewed or grinding the pulp; that is to say, there is no benefit in it. However, if one is engaged in his own occupational duty as ordered by the Supreme Lord, his sinful activities are certainly diminished. Therefore if one is engaged in his occupational duty by force, he benefits because he can vanquish all his sinful activities in that way.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>This argument offered by Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Rah&#363;gan&#803;a is certainly very effective. In his Bhakti-ras&#257;mr&#803;ta-sindhu (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/brs1/2/4">1.2.4</A>), &#346;r&#299;la R&#363;pa Gosv&#257;m&#299; says, tasm&#257;t ken&#257;py up&#257;yena manah&#803; kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;e nive&#347;ayet: somehow or other, one should engage in Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness. Actually every living being is an eternal servant of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, but due to forgetfulness, a living entity engages himself as an eternal servant of m&#257;y&#257;. As long as one is engaged in m&#257;y&#257;'s service, he cannot be happy. Our Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness movement aims at engaging people in Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's service. That will help them become freed from all material contamination and sinful activity. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/10.htm">4.10</A>): v&#299;ta-r&#257;ga-bhaya-krodh&#257;h&#803;. By becoming detached from material activities, we will be freed from fear and anger. By austerity, one becomes purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The duty of the king is to rule his citizens in such a way that they can become Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a conscious. This would be very beneficial for everyone. Unfortunately the king or president engages people in sense gratification instead of the Lord's service, and such activities are certainly not beneficial for anyone. King Rah&#363;gan&#803;a tried to engage Jad&#803;a Bharata in carrying the palanquin, which is a form of sense gratification for the King. However, if one is engaged as a palanquin carrier in the Lord's service, that is certainly beneficial. In this godless civilization, if a president engages people somehow or other in devotional service or the awakening of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, he renders the very best service to the citizens.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="22.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="24.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
