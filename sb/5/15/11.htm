All the kings with whom Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the br&#257;hman&#803;as in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's munificent charities. Consequently the br&#257;hman&#803;as contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya's benefit in the next life.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As a ks&#803;atriya or emperor, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the br&#257;hman&#803;as who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the br&#257;hman&#803;as and ks&#803;atriyas were all satisfied with Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya because of his proper administration. In other words. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya satisfied the ks&#803;atriya kings by his fighting and satisfied the br&#257;hman&#803;as by his charities. The vai&#347;yas were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya's constant sacrifices, the &#347;&#363;dras were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When br&#257;hman&#803;as and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/34.htm">4.34</A>), tad viddhi pran&#803;ip&#257;tena paripra&#347;nena sevay&#257;: one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="10.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="12.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
