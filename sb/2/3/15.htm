Even while playing with dolls, he used to worship Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a by imitating the worship of the family Deity.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/6/41.htm">6.41</A>) it is stated that even a person who has failed in the proper discharge of yoga practice is given a chance to take birth in the house of devout br&#257;hman&#803;as or in the houses of rich men like ks&#803;atriya kings or rich merchants. But Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it was more than that because he had been a great devotee of the Lord since his previous birth, and as such he took his birth in an imperial family of the Kurus, and especially that of the P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas. So from the very beginning of his childhood he had the chance to know intimately the devotional service of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a in his own family. The P&#257;n&#803;d&#803;avas, all being devotees of the Lord, certainly venerated family Deities in the royal palace for worship. Children who appear in such families fortunately generally imitate such worship of the Deities, even in the way of childhood play. By the grace of Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, we had the chance of being born in a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava family, and in our childhood we imitated the worship of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a by imitating our father. Our father encouraged us in all respects to observe all functions such as the Ratha-y&#257;tr&#257; and Dola-y&#257;tr&#257; ceremonies, and he used to spend money liberally for distributing pras&#257;da to us children and our friends. Our spiritual master, who also took his birth in a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava family, got all inspirations from his great Vais&#803;n&#803;ava father, T&#803;h&#257;kura Bhaktivinoda. That is the way of all lucky Vais&#803;n&#803;ava families. The celebrated M&#299;r&#257; B&#257;&#299; was a staunch devotee of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a as the great lifter of Govardhana Hill.</P><P>The life history of many such devotees is almost the same because there is always symmetry between the early lives of all great devotees of the Lord. According to J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it must have heard about the childhood pastimes of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a at Vr&#803;nd&#257;vana, for he used to imitate the pastimes with his young playmates. According to &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299;, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it used to imitate the worship of the family Deity by elderly members. &#346;r&#299;la Vi&#347;van&#257;tha Cakravart&#299; also confirms the viewpoint of J&#299;va Gosv&#257;m&#299;. So accepting either of them, Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Par&#299;ks&#803;it was naturally inclined to Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a from his very childhood. He might have imitated either of the above-mentioned activities, and all of them establish his great devotion from his very childhood, a symptom of a mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavata. Such mah&#257;-bh&#257;gavatas are called nitya-siddhas, or souls liberated from birth. But there are also others, who may not be liberated from birth but who develop a tendency for devotional service by association, and they are called s&#257;dhana-siddhas. There is no difference between the two in the ultimate issue, and so the conclusion is that everyone can become a s&#257;dhana-siddha, a devotee of the Lord, simply by association with the pure devotees. The concrete example is our great spiritual master &#346;r&#299; N&#257;rada Muni. In his previous life he was simply a boy of a maidservant, but through association with great devotees he became a devotee of the Lord of his own standard, unique in the history of devotional service.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="16.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
