As described by the Vais&#803;n&#803;ava poet Jayadeva Gosv&#257;m&#299;, pralaya-payodhi jale dhr&#803;tav&#257;n asi vedam **. Let us begin tracing the evolutionary process from the point of devastation (pralaya), when the whole universe is filled with water. At that time there are many fishes and other aquatics, and from these aquatics evolve creepers, trees, etc. From these, insects and reptiles evolve, and from them birds, beasts and then human beings and finally civilized human beings. Now, the civilized human being is at a junction where he can make further evolutionary progress in spiritual life. Here it is stated (sva-dharma-nis&#803;t&#803;hah&#803;) that when a living entity comes to a civilized form of life, there must be sva-dharma, social divisions according to one's work and qualifications. This is indicated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/13.htm">4.13</A>):</P><P>c&#257;tur-varn&#803;yam&#769; may&#257; sr&#803;s&#803;t&#803;am&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>gun&#803;a-karma-vibh&#257;ga&#347;ah&#803;</P><P>"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me."</P><P>In civilized human society there must be the divisions of br&#257;hman&#803;a, ks&#803;atriya, vai&#347;ya and &#347;&#363;dra, and everyone must properly execute his occupational duty in accordance with his division. Here it is described (svadharma-nis&#803;t&#803;hah&#803;) that it does not matter whether one is a br&#257;hman&#803;a, ks&#803;atriya, vai&#347;ya or &#347;&#363;dra. If one sticks to his position and properly executes his particular duty, he is considered a civilized human being. Otherwise he is no better than an animal. It is also mentioned herein that whoever executes his occupational duty (sva-dharma) for one hundred births (for instance, if a br&#257;hman&#803;a continues to act as a br&#257;hman&#803;a) becomes eligible for promotion to Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahm&#257; lives. There is also a planet called &#346;ivaloka, or Sad&#257;&#347;ivaloka, which is situated in a marginal position between the spiritual and material worlds. If, after being situated in Brahmaloka, one becomes more qualified, he is promoted to Sad&#257;&#347;ivaloka. Similarly, when one becomes even more qualified, he can attain the Vaikun&#803;t&#803;halokas. The Vaikun&#803;t&#803;halokas are targets for everyone, even the demigods, and they can be attained by a devotee who has no desire for material benefit. As indicated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/8/16.htm">8.16</A>), one does not escape material miseries even if he is elevated to Brahmaloka (&#257;brahma-bhuvan&#257;l lok&#257;h&#803; punar &#257;vartino 'rjuna). Similarly, one is not very safe even if he is promoted to &#346;ivaloka, because the planet of &#346;ivaloka is marginal. However, if one attains Vaikun&#803;t&#803;haloka, he attains the highest perfection of life and the end of the evolutionary process (m&#257;m upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate). In other words, it is confirmed herein that a person in human society who has developed consciousness must take to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness in order to be promoted to Vaikun&#803;t&#803;haloka or Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;aloka immediately after leaving the body. Tyaktv&#257; deham&#769; punar janma naiti m&#257;m eti so 'rjuna (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/9.htm">Bg. 4.9</A>). A devotee who is fully in Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, who is not attracted by any other loka, or planet, including Brahmaloka and &#346;ivaloka, is immediately transferred to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;aloka (m&#257;m eti). That is the highest perfection of life and the perfection of the evolutionary process.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
