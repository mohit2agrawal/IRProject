As protector of the br&#257;hman&#803;as, you always protect the regulative principles they follow, just as a cowherd boy keeps a stick in his hand to give protection to the cows.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The specific function of a human being in society, irrespective of his social status, is to practice control of the mind and senses by observing the regulative principles enjoined in the Vedic &#347;&#257;stras. Lord &#346;iva is called pa&#347;upati because he protects the living entities in their developed consciousness so that they may follow the Vedic system of varn&#803;a and &#257;&#347;rama. The word pa&#347;u refers to the animal as well as to the human entity. It is stated here that Lord &#346;iva is always interested in protecting the animals and the animalistic living entities, who are not very advanced in the spiritual sense. It is also stated that the br&#257;hman&#803;as are produced from the mouth of the Supreme Lord. We should always remember that Lord &#346;iva is being addressed as the representative of the Supreme Lord, Vis&#803;n&#803;u. ln the Vedic literature it is described that the br&#257;hman&#803;as are born from the mouth of the universal form of Vis&#803;n&#803;u, the ks&#803;atriyas are born from His arms, the vai&#347;yas from His abdomen or waist, and the &#347;&#363;dras from His legs. In the formation of a body, the head is the principal factor. The br&#257;hman&#803;as are born from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to accept charity for worship of Vis&#803;n&#803;u and to spread Vedic knowledge. Lord &#346;iva is known as pa&#347;upati, the protector of the br&#257;hman&#803;as and other living entities. He protects them from the attacks of non-br&#257;hman&#803;as, or uncultured persons who are against the self-realization process.</P><P>Another feature of this word is that persons who are simply attached to the ritualistic portion of the Vedas and do not understand the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not any more advanced than animals. In the beginning of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam it is confirmed that even though one performs the rituals of the Vedas, if he does not develop a sense of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, then all his labor in performing Vedic rituals is considered to be simply a waste of time. Lord &#346;iva's aim in destroying the Daks&#803;a yaj&#241;a was to punish Daks&#803;a because by neglecting him (Lord &#346;iva), Daks&#803;a was committing a great offense. Lord &#346;iva's punishment was just like that of a cowherd boy, who keeps a stick to frighten his animals. It is commonly said that to give protection to animals, a stick is needed because animals cannot reason and argue. Their reasoning and argument is argumentum ad baculum; unless there is a rod, they do not obey. Force is required for the animalistic class of men, whereas those who are advanced are convinced by reasons, arguments and scriptural authority. Persons who are simply attached to Vedic rituals, without further advancement of devotional service, or Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness, are almost like animals, and Lord &#346;iva is in charge of giving them protection and sometimes punishing them, as he punished Daks&#803;a.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="13.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="15.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
