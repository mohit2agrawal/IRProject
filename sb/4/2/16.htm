He was so angry that he did not acknowledge that the request was from his father. Instead, he referred to Brahm&#257; as parames&#803;t&#803;h&#299;, the supreme teacher in the universe; because of his temperament of gross anger, he was not even prepared to accept Brahm&#257; as his father. In other words, he accused even Brahm&#257; of being less intelligent because he had advised Daks&#803;a to hand over his beautiful daughter to such a nasty fellow. In anger one forgets everything, and thus Daks&#803;a, in anger, not only accused the great Lord &#346;iva, but criticized his own father, Lord Brahm&#257;, for his not very astute advice that Daks&#803;a hand over his daughter to Lord &#346;iva.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="14-15.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="17.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
