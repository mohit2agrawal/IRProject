The purpose of marriage, therefore, is to have a putra, or son who is able to deliver his father, even if the father falls down to the hellish condition of put. Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Pr&#803;thu's father, Vena, was a most sinful person and was therefore cursed to death by the br&#257;hman&#803;as. Now all the great saintly persons, sages and br&#257;hman&#803;as present in the meeting, after hearing from Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Pr&#803;thu about his great mission in life, became convinced that the statement of the Vedas had been fully proved. The purpose of accepting a wife in religious marriage, as sanctioned in the Vedas, is to have a putra, a son qualified to deliver his father from the darkest region of hellish life. Marriage is not intended for sense gratification but for getting a son fully qualified to deliver his father. But if a son is raised to become an unqualified demon, how can he deliver his father from hellish life? It is therefore the duty of a father to become a Vais&#803;n&#803;ava and raise his children to become Vais&#803;n&#803;avas; then even if by chance the father falls into a hellish life in his next birth, such a son can deliver him, as Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Pr&#803;thu delivered his father.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
