In the meantime he became as brilliant and illuminating as molten gold. He was thus completely prepared to board the transcendental plane.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the absolute world, the plane, the associates of Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u and Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u Himself are all spiritual. There is no material contamination. In quality, everything there is one. As Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is worshipable, so also are His associates, His paraphernalia, His airplane and His abode, for everything of Vis&#803;n&#803;u's is as good as Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u. Dhruva Mah&#257;r&#257;ja knew all this very well, as a pure Vais&#803;n&#803;ava, and he offered his respects to the associates and to the plane before riding in it. But in the meantime, his body changed into spiritual existence, and therefore it was illuminating like molten gold. In this way he also became one with the other paraphernalia of Vis&#803;n&#803;uloka.</P><P>M&#257;y&#257;v&#257;d&#299; philosophers cannot imagine how this oneness can be achieved even in different varieties. Their idea of oneness is that there is no variety. Therefore they have become impersonalists. As &#346;i&#347;um&#257;ra, Vis&#803;n&#803;uloka or Dhruvaloka are completely different from this material world, so a Vis&#803;n&#803;u temple within this world is also completely different from this material world. As soon as we are in a temple we should know very well that we are situated differently from the material world. In the temple, Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, His throne, His room and all other things associated with the temple are transcendental. The three modes, sattva-gun&#803;a, rajo-gun&#803;a and tamo-gun&#803;a, have no entrance into the temple. It is said, therefore, that to live in the forest is in the mode of goodness, to live in the city is in the mode of passion, and to live in a brothel, liquor shop or slaughterhouse is in the mode of ignorance. But to live in the temple means to live in Vaikun&#803;t&#803;haloka. Everything in the temple is as worshipable as Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, or Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="28.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="30.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
