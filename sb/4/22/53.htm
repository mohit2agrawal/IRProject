Indeed, all his sons were begotten according to his own desire.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>As a householder, Pr&#803;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja had five sons by his wife, Arci, and all these sons were begotten as he desired them. They were not born whimsically or by accident. How one can beget children according to one's own desire is practically unknown in the present age (Kali-yuga). In this regard the secret of success depends on the parents' acceptance of the various purificatory methods known as sam&#769;sk&#257;ras. The first sam&#769;sk&#257;ra, the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sam&#769;sk&#257;ra, or child-begetting sam&#769;sk&#257;ra, is compulsory, especially for the higher castes, the br&#257;hman&#803;as and the ks&#803;atriyas. As stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;, sex life which is not against religious principles is Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a Himself, and according to religious principles, when one wants to beget a child he must perform the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na-sam&#769;sk&#257;ra before having sex. The mental state of the father and mother before sex will certainly affect the mentality of the child to be begotten. A child who is begotten out of lust may not turn out as the parents desire. As stated in the &#347;&#257;stras, yath&#257; yonir yath&#257; b&#299;jam. Yath&#257; yonih&#803; indicates the mother, and yath&#257; b&#299;jam indicates the father. If the mental state of the parents is prepared before they have sex, the child which they will beget will certainly reflect their mental condition. It is therefore understood by the words &#257;tma-sammat&#257;n that both Pr&#803;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja and Arci underwent the garbh&#257;dh&#257;na purificatory process before begetting children, and thus they begot all their sons according to their desires and purified mental states. Pr&#803;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja did not beget his children out of lust, nor was he attracted to his wife for sense gratificatory purposes. He begot the children as a gr&#803;hastha for the future administration of his government all over the world.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="54.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
