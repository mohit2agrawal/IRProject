It is my duty, therefore, to offer you something, but all I possess are but remnants of food taken by great saintly persons. What shall I give?</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>The word s&#257;dh&#363;cchis&#803;t&#803;am is significant in this verse. Pr&#803;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja got his kingdom from great saintly persons like Bhr&#803;gu and others just as one gets remnants of food. After the death of King Vena, the whole world was bereft of a popular ruler. There were so many catastrophes occurring that the great saintly persons, headed by Bhr&#803;gu, created the body of King Pr&#803;thu out of the body of his dead father, King Vena. Since King Pr&#803;thu was thus offered the kingdom by the virtue of the mercy of great saintly persons, he did not want to divide his kingdom among saints like the Kum&#257;ras. When a father is eating food, he may, out of compassion, offer the remnants of his food to his son. Although such food may be already chewed by the father, it cannot be offered to the father again. Pr&#803;thu Mah&#257;r&#257;ja's position was something like this; whatever he possessed had already been chewed, and therefore he could not offer it to the Kum&#257;ras. Indirectly, however, he offered everything he possessed to the Kum&#257;ras, and consequently they utilized his possessions in whatever way they liked. The next verse clarifies this matter.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="42.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="44.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
