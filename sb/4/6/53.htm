In the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, First Canto, Second Chapter, it is stated that everyone should try to understand whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by his activity. In other words, the aim of our activities should be to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as in an office it is the duty of the worker to see that the proprietor or the master is satisfied, so everyone's duty is to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by one's activity. Activities to satisfy the Supreme Godhead are prescribed in the Vedic literature, and execution of such activities is called yaj&#241;a. In other words, acting on behalf of the Supreme Lord is called yaj&#241;a. One should know very well that any activity besides yaj&#241;a is the cause of material bondage. That is explained in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/9.htm">3.9</A>): yaj&#241;&#257;rth&#257;t karman&#803;o 'nyatra loko 'yam&#769; karma-bandhanah&#803;. Karma-bandhanah&#803; means that if we do not work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, Vis&#803;n&#803;u, then the reaction of our work will bind us. One should not work for his own sense gratification. Everyone should work for the satisfaction of God. That is called yaj&#241;a.</P><P>After the yaj&#241;a was performed by Daks&#803;a, all the demigods expected pras&#257;da, the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Vis&#803;n&#803;u. Lord &#346;iva is one of the demigods, so naturally he also expected his share of the pras&#257;da from the yaj&#241;a. But Daks&#803;a, out of his envy of Lord &#346;iva, neither invited &#346;iva to participate in the yaj&#241;a nor gave him his share after the offering. But after the destruction of the yaj&#241;a arena by the followers of Lord &#346;iva, Lord Brahm&#257; pacified him and assured him that he would get his share of pras&#257;da. Thus he was requested to rectify whatever destruction was caused by his followers.</P><P>In Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/3/11.htm">3.11</A>) it is said that all the demigods are satisfied when one performs yaj&#241;a. Because the demigods expect pras&#257;da from yaj&#241;as, yaj&#241;a must be performed. Those who engage in sense gratificatory, materialistic activities must perform yaj&#241;a, otherwise they will be implicated. Thus Daks&#803;a, being the father of mankind, was performing yaj&#241;a, and Lord &#346;iva expected his share. But since &#346;iva was not invited, there was trouble. By the mediation of Lord Brahm&#257;, however, everything was settled satisfactorily.</P><P>The performance of yaj&#241;a is a very difficult task because all the demigods must be invited to participate in the yaj&#241;a. In this Kali-yuga it is not possible to perform such costly sacrifices, nor is it possible to invite the demigods to participate. Therefore in this age it is recommended, yaj&#241;aih&#803; sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-pr&#257;yair yajanti hi sumedhasah&#803; (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/11/5/32.htm">11.5.32</A>). Those who are intelligent should know that in the Kali-yuga there is no possibility of performing the Vedic sacrifices. But unless one pleases the demigods, there will be no regulated seasonal activities or rainfall. Everything is controlled by the demigods. Under the circumstances, in this age, in order to keep the balance of social peace and prosperity, all intelligent men should execute the performance of sa&#324;k&#299;rtana-yaj&#241;a by chanting the holy names Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, Hare Hare/ Hare R&#257;ma, Hare R&#257;ma, R&#257;ma R&#257;ma, Hare Hare. One should invite people, chant Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and then distribute pras&#257;da. This yaj&#241;a will satisfy all the demigods, and thus there will be peace and prosperity in the world. Another difficulty in performing the Vedic rituals is that if one fails to satisfy even one demigod out of the many hundreds of thousands of demigods, just as Daks&#803;a failed to satisfy Lord &#346;iva, there will be disaster. But in this age the performance of sacrifice has been simplified. One can chant Hare Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, and by pleasing Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a one can satisfy all the demigods automatically.</P><P>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam, entitled "Brahm&#257; Satisfies Lord &#346;iva."</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="52.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="../7/1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
