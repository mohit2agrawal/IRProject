Your Lordship always takes away the devotee's miserable conditions, for Your brain plans how to do so. You live everywhere as Param&#257;tm&#257;; therefore You are known as V&#257;sudeva. You also accept Vasudeva as Your father, and You are celebrated by the name Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. You are so kind that You always increase the influence of all kinds of devotees.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>In the previous verse it has been said (gr&#803;h&#299;ta-m&#257;y&#257;-gun&#803;a-vigrah&#257;ya) that the Lord accepts three kinds of bodies (Vis&#803;n&#803;u, Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva) for the purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic manifestation. The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahm&#257;, Vis&#803;n&#803;u and &#346;iva) are called gun&#803;a-avat&#257;ras. There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the first incarnations within this material world are Brahm&#257;, Vis&#803;n&#803;u and Mahe&#347;vara (&#346;iva). Out of these three, Lord Brahm&#257; and Lord &#346;iva accept material bodies, but Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u does not accept a material body. Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is therefore known as vi&#347;uddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is in the same category with Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva. The &#347;&#257;stras forbid us to think in this way.</P><P>yas tu n&#257;r&#257;yan&#803;am&#769; devam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>brahma-rudr&#257;di-daivataih&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>samatvenaiva v&#299;ks&#803;eta</P><P CLASS=n>sa p&#257;s&#803;an&#803;d&#803;&#299; bhaved dhruvam</P><P>One who considers Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u to be in the same category with devas like Lord Brahm&#257; or Lord &#346;iva or who thinks Lord Brahm&#257; and &#346;iva to be equal to Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is to be considered as p&#257;s&#803;an&#803;d&#803;&#299; (a faithless nonbeliever). Therefore in this verse Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u is distinguished in the words namo vi&#347;uddha-sattv&#257;ya. Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahm&#257; is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahm&#257;. Lord &#346;iva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Vis&#803;n&#803;u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahm&#257;, the living entity. Lord &#346;iva is therefore explained in Brahma-sam&#769;hit&#257; (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bs/5/45.htm">5.45</A>) in this way:</P><P>ks&#803;&#299;ram&#769; yath&#257; dadhi vik&#257;ra-vi&#347;es&#803;a-yog&#257;t</P><P CLASS=n>sa&#241;j&#257;yate na hi tatah&#803; pr&#803;thag asti hetoh&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>yah&#803; &#347;ambhut&#257;m api tath&#257; samupaiti k&#257;ry&#257;d</P><P CLASS=n>govindam &#257;di-purus&#803;am&#769; tam aham&#769; bhaj&#257;mi</P><P>Lord &#346;iva is considered to be like yogurt (dadhi). Yogurt is nothing but transformed milk; nonetheless, yogurt cannot be accepted as milk. Similarly, Lord &#346;iva holds almost all the powers of Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u, and he is also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like Vis&#803;n&#803;u, just as yogurt, although transformed milk, is not exactly like milk.</P><P>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also described herein as v&#257;sudev&#257;ya kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;&#257;ya. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all Vis&#803;n&#803;u expansions are His plenary portions or portions of His plenary portions (known as sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a and kal&#257;). The sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a, or direct expansion, is also called am&#769;&#347;a. All vis&#803;n&#803;u-tattvas are sv&#257;m&#769;&#347;a, direct parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a. Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is known as V&#257;sudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of Vasudeva. Similarly, He is known as Devak&#299;-nandana, Ya&#347;od&#257;-nandana, Nanda-nandana and so on.</P><P>Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the influence of His devotees. Therefore He is described herein as prabhave sarva-s&#257;tvat&#257;m. The s&#257;tvata community is a community of Vais&#803;n&#803;avas, pure devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited powers, and He wants to see that His devotees are also entrusted with unlimited powers. A devotee of the Lord is always, therefore, distinguished from all other living entities.</P><P>The word hari means "one who takes away all miserable conditions," and hari-medhase means that the Lord is always planning ways to deliver the conditioned soul from the clutches of m&#257;y&#257;. The Lord is so kind that He personally incarnates to deliver the conditioned souls, and whenever He comes, He makes His plans.</P><P>paritr&#257;n&#803;&#257;ya s&#257;dh&#363;n&#257;m&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>vin&#257;&#347;&#257;ya ca dus&#803;kr&#803;t&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>dharma-sam&#769;sth&#257;pan&#257;rth&#257;ya</P><P CLASS=n>sambhav&#257;mi yuge yuge</P><P>"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/4/8.htm">Bg. 4.8</A>)</P><P>Since the Lord delivers all conditioned souls from the clutches of m&#257;y&#257;, He is known as hari-medhas. In the list of incarnations, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is described as the supreme and original Personality of Godhead.</P><P>ete c&#257;m&#769;&#347;a-kal&#257;h&#803; pum&#769;sah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;as tu bhagav&#257;n svayam</P><P CLASS=n>indr&#257;ri-vy&#257;kulam&#769; lokam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>mr&#803;d&#803;ayanti yuge yuge</P><P>(Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/1/3/28.htm">1.3.28</A>)</P><P>Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the original Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world when the demigods, who are devotees of the Lord, are disturbed by the demons.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="23.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="25.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
