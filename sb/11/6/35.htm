Let us go this very day to the most pious place Prabh&#257;sa. We have no time to delay.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Many demigods, coming to the earth to assist Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a in His pastimes, took birth within the Yadu dynasty and appeared as Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's associates. When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send these demigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Each demigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home, back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, in many cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to die outside the city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;. Thus Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, pretending to be an ordinary living being, said, "We are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabh&#257;sa." In this way, by His yoga-m&#257;y&#257; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a bewildered such demigod members of the Yadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabh&#257;sa.</P><P>Since Dv&#257;rak&#257; is parama-ma&#324;gala, the most auspicious place, not even an imitation of inauspiciousness can take place there. Actually, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's pastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since it outwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dv&#257;rak&#257;; therefore Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a led the Yadus away from Dv&#257;rak&#257;. After having sent the demigods back to their planets, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a planned to return to the spiritual world, Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dv&#257;rak&#257;.</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la Bhaktisiddh&#257;nta Sarasvat&#299; T&#803;h&#257;kura has made the following important comments on this verse. Prabh&#257;sa is a famous holy place located near the Veraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty of the Eleventh Canto of &#346;r&#299;mad-Bh&#257;gavatam it is written that after hearing the words of &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Y&#257;davas went to the mainland from the island city of Dv&#257;rak&#257; by means of boats and then traveled to Prabh&#257;sa in chariots. At Prabh&#257;sa-ks&#803;etra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in a mutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalks of cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation.</P><P>Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, manifesting His four-armed form, sat down under a pippala tree, placing His left foot, the heel of which was colored red like the red koka-nada lotus, upon His right thigh. A hunter named Jar&#257;, watching from the shore of the ocean at Prabh&#257;sa, mistook the Lord's red-colored foot to be the face of a deer and shot his arrow at it.</P><P>At the base of that same pippala tree under which Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a had sat there is now a temple. One mile away from the tree, on the seashore, is the V&#299;ra-prabha&#241;jana Mat&#803;ha, and it is said that from this point the hunter Jar&#257; fired his arrow.</P><P>In the conclusion to his work Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata-t&#257;tparya-nirn&#803;aya, &#346;r&#299; Madhv&#257;c&#257;rya-p&#257;da has written the following purport to the maus&#803;ala-l&#299;l&#257;. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensure that the word of His own devotees and of the br&#257;hman&#803;as be maintained, created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But the Lord's actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jar&#257;, who is actually the Lord's devotee Bhr&#803;gu R&#803;s&#803;i. In a previous age Bhr&#803;gu Muni had placed his foot on the chest of Lord Vis&#803;n&#803;u. In order to counteract the offense of improperly placing his foot on the Lord's chest, Bhr&#803;gu had to take birth as a degraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a low birth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such a fallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end of Dv&#257;para-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, His devotee Bhr&#803;gu, in the form of the hunter Jar&#257;, would cast the arrow into a material body created by the Lord's illusory energy. Thus the hunter would become remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaikun&#803;t&#803;ha-loka.</P><P>Therefore, to please His devotee Bhr&#803;gu and to confuse the demons, the Supreme Lord manifested His maus&#803;ala-l&#299;l&#257; at Prabh&#257;sa, but it should be understood that this is an illusory pastime. The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of the material qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from the womb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended into the maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, He similarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering the demons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out of His material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His own sac-cid-&#257;nanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory, material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord &#346;r&#299; Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a's actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death.</P><P>Also at Prabh&#257;sa-ks&#803;etra there is the holy place known as Bhr&#803;gu-t&#299;rtha, which was manifested by Lord Para&#347;ur&#257;ma. The place at which the two rivers Sarasvat&#299; and Hiran&#803;y&#257; flow together into the ocean is named Bhr&#803;gu-t&#299;rtha, and there the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description of Prabh&#257;sa-t&#299;rtha in the Prabh&#257;sa-khan&#803;d&#803;a of the Skanda Pur&#257;n&#803;a. There are also many phala-&#347;rutis given within the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata in connection with Prabh&#257;sa-t&#299;rtha. Phala-&#347;rutis are scriptural statements that promise various auspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In the following verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to be derived from visiting Prabh&#257;saks&#803;etra and performing religious activities there.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="34.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="36.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
