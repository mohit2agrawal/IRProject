Sometimes foolish people say that religious life is a crutch for those who are not expert enough to achieve a high status in society. Therefore King Yadu has described the qualities of the mendicant br&#257;hman&#803;a in order to show that the br&#257;hman&#803;a has taken to renounced spiritual life in spite of great potential for worldly success. The avadh&#363;ta br&#257;hman&#803;a is described as being expert, learned, good-looking, eloquent and in every sense qualified to be a great material success. Still, the avadh&#363;ta has renounced material life and taken to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness. Going back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge is the real work of a human being.</P><P>The followers of Lord Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu simultaneously cultivate their own Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness and strenuously endeavor in missionary work to help others become Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a conscious. Often foolish persons deride the devotees by saying, "Why don't you get a job?" They think that one who is sincerely endeavoring for spiritual enlightenment and who is also enlightening others is not doing anything practical. Foolish materialists will pay millions of dollars to extend their lives by a few weeks or months in a hospital, but they do not appreciate someone endeavoring for eternal life. There is no actual logic in material life. The act of trying to enjoy without Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a is in itself the culmination of irrationality, and thus we cannot expect to find anything ultimately rational or logical in a materialistic life devoid of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness. Many devotees of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a come from wealthy, learned and influential families, and they take to Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness in order to perfect their lives, and certainly not due to lack of opportunity for material advancement. Although sometimes persons in material distress approach the Supreme Lord for help in material life, a real devotee of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a voluntarily gives up all types of material enjoyment, knowing that nothing but love of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and service to His lotus feet are the actual perfection of life.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="27.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="29.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
