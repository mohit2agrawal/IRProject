I am obviously a great fool, for I did not properly execute pious activities. I could not satisfy myself, nor could I fulfill the purpose of life. My dear family, which was the basis of my religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, is now hopelessly ruined.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>&#346;r&#299;la &#346;r&#299;dhara Sv&#257;m&#299; explains that the word atr&#803;ptasya indicates that the pigeon was not satisfied with the sense gratification he had achieved. Although he was completely attached to his wife, children and nest, he could not sufficiently enjoy them since there is ultimately no satisfaction in such things. Akr&#803;t&#257;rthasya indicates that his hopes and dreams for future expansion of his sense gratification were now also ruined. People commonly refer to their "home, sweet home" as their nest, and money put aside for future sense gratification is called a nest egg. Therefore, all of the love birds of the material world should clearly note how their so-called wife, children and fortune will all be dragged away in the hunter's net. In other words, death will finish everything.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="67.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="69.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
