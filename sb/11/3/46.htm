The material fruitive results offered in the revealed scriptures are not the actual goal of Vedic knowledge, but are meant for stimulating the interest of the performer.</P><P CLASS=t>PURPORT</P><P>Human life is an opportunity offered by the laws of nature to the conditioned soul so that he may understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, even in the human form of life most living entities remain addicted to improving the standard of animal activities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Almost no one is interested in the actual success of life, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness.</P><P>&#347;rotavy&#257;d&#299;ni r&#257;jendra</P><P CLASS=n>nr&#803;n&#803;&#257;m&#769; santi sahasra&#347;ah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>apa&#347;yat&#257;m &#257;tma-tattvam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>gr&#803;hes&#803;u gr&#803;ha-medhin&#257;m</P><P>"Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." (Bh&#257;g. <A CLASS=v HREF="../../../sb/2/1/2.htm">2.1.2</A>)</P><P>It is stated, parama-k&#257;run&#803;iko vedah&#803; &#8212; "Vedic knowledge is supremely merciful" &#8212; because it engages the animalistic human beings in a gradual process of purification that culminates in full consciousness of Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; (vedai&#347; ca sarvair aham eva vedyah&#803; [<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/15/15.htm">Bg. 15.15</A>]). The majority of human beings are not able to suddenly give up material sense gratification, even though they understand from Vedic literature that such sense gratification causes a pernicious future effect. We have practical experience in the Western countries that when the government informed the citizens that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, most people were unable to give up their smoking habit. Therefore, the Vedic literature prescribes a gradual process of purification in which the conditioned soul learns to offer the results of his material activities to the Supreme Lord, thus spiritualizing those activities. Material sense gratification is based on two organs, namely the tongue for tasting and the genitals for sex life. By offering palatable food to the Deity of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a and then enjoying the remnants as kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a-pras&#257;dam and by accepting the rules and regulations for Vedic householder life and begetting of Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a conscious children, one can gradually bring the full range of material activities to the platform of pure devotional service. By offering the fruits of one's ordinary activities to the Supreme Lord, one gradually understands that the Lord Himself, and not material sense gratification, is the actual goal of life. Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a warns in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257; that if people are prematurely encouraged to give up householder life or the sumptuous remnants of the Lord's pras&#257;dam, such artificial renunciation will have the opposite effect.</P><P>There is a class of duplicitous men who misunderstand the transcendental purpose of the Vedas and falsely claim that material fruitive results such as promotion to heaven, which is offered in the agnis&#803;t&#803;oma sacrifice, constitute the ultimate goal of the Vedas. Such foolish men have been described by Lord Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a:</P><P>y&#257;m im&#257;m&#769; pus&#803;pit&#257;m&#769; v&#257;cam&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>pravadanty avipa&#347;citah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>veda-v&#257;da-rat&#257;h&#803; p&#257;rtha</P><P CLASS=n>n&#257;nyad ast&#299;ti v&#257;dinah&#803;</P><P CLASS=n>k&#257;m&#257;tm&#257;nah&#803; svarga-par&#257;</P><P CLASS=n>janma-karma-phala-prad&#257;m</P><P CLASS=n>kriy&#257;-vi&#347;es&#803;a-bahul&#257;m&#769;</P><P CLASS=n>bhogai&#347;varya-gatim&#769; prati</P><P>"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this." (<A CLASS=v HREF="../../../bg/2/42.htm">Bg. 2.42-43</A>) To refute such a foolish understanding of the Vedic purpose, this verse uses the word nih&#803;sa&#324;gah&#803;, which means "without attachment to material results." The actual purpose of the Vedas is arpitam &#299;&#347;vare, to offer everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The result is siddhim, or the perfection of life, Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a consciousness.</P><P>The words rocan&#257;rth&#257; phala-&#347;rutih&#803; clearly indicate that the fruitive results promised in the Vedic literature are meant to stimulate a materialistic person to have faith in the Vedic injunctions. The example is given that a child may be offered candy-covered medicine. The child becomes enthusiastic to take the medicine because of the candy coating, whereas a mature person will be enthusiastic to take the medicine itself, knowing that such medicine is meant for his real self-interest. The mature platform of Vedic understanding is mentioned in the Br&#803;had-&#257;ran&#803;yaka Upanis&#803;ad (<A CLASS=v HREF="http://vedabase.net/todo/upanisad/4/4/22">4.4.22</A>): tam etam&#769; ved&#257;nuvacanena br&#257;hman&#803;&#257; vividis&#803;anti brahmacaryen&#803;a tapas&#257; &#347;raddhay&#257; yaj&#241;en&#257;n&#257;&#347;akena ca. "By the teaching of the Vedas and by celibacy, penances, faith and controlled eating, great br&#257;hman&#803;as come to know the Supreme." The Supreme is Kr&#803;s&#803;n&#803;a, as stated in Bhagavad-g&#299;t&#257;. Although the prescribed rituals of the Vedas may sometimes resemble material fruitive work, the activity is spiritualized because the result is offered to the Supreme. Candy-covered medicine and ordinary candy may appear or taste the same. But the candy-covered medicine has a therapeutic effect not found in ordinary candy. Similarly, the words nais&#803;karmyam&#769; labhate siddhim in this verse indicate that a faithful follower of the Vedic injunctions will gradually be promoted to the highest perfection of life, pure love of Godhead, as stated by Caitanya Mah&#257;prabhu (prem&#257; pum-artho mah&#257;n).</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="45.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="47.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
