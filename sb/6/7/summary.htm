Br&#803;haspati therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request of the demigods, Vi&#347;var&#363;pa, the son of the br&#257;hman&#803;a Tvas&#803;t&#803;&#257;, became their priest.</P><P>Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife &#346;ac&#299;dev&#299; and being praised by various demigods like the Siddhas, C&#257;ran&#803;as and Gandharvas when Br&#803;haspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, entered the assembly. Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did not respect Br&#803;haspati, who thus became aware of Indra's pride in his material opulence and immediately disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon from his spiritual master, but could not find Br&#803;haspati anywhere.</P><P>Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master. Indra lost all his opulence and was conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra's throne. King Indra, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahm&#257;. Understanding the situation, Lord Brahm&#257; chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahm&#257;'s orders, the demigods accepted Vi&#347;var&#363;pa, who was a br&#257;hman&#803;a and the son of Tvas&#803;t&#803;&#257;, as their priest. Then they performed yaj&#241;as under the priesthood of Vi&#347;var&#363;pa and were able to conquer the demons.</P><P CLASS=l><A CLASS=i HREF="../6/45.htm">&lt;&lt;&lt;</A> <A CLASS=i HREF="1.htm">&gt;&gt;&gt;</A></P><P CLASS=v><A CLASS=v HREF="http://www.thekrishnastore.com/Detail.bok?no=795"><IMG SRC="../../../bbt.gif" ALT="Buy Online"> Copyright &#169; The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc.</A><BR>His Divine Grace A.
